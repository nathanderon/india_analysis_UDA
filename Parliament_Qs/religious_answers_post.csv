Further, every action of the investigating agency is subject to court/legal scrutiny - including the issue of bail, conviction and sentencing. Acquittal by Courts is also an outcome of a free and fair trial. The law enables the Courts at the conclusion of trial, if it results in an acquittal, to pass strictures on the nature and quality of the investigation and evidence collected. However, in every case, acquittal from charges cannot be considered to prove that innocent civilians are being wrongly framed. The acquittal by the Courts may also be because of lack of sufficient evidence, which could establish/prove charges beyond all reasonable doubt. As far as the compensation package to the youth is concerned, it is for the Courts to pronounce compensation on prayer by the accused if he establishes that he was a victim of false and malicious prosecution. Persons guilty of false and malicious prosecution can also be charged under section 211 of IPC.******",199950.0

Section 19 of the Act covered power of Central Government to compulsory acquisition of antiquity and art treasure while Section 20 pertain payment of the compensation for antiquity and art treasure to be compulsory acquired.

These objects are further examined by the same committee when brought back to assess damage if any. : 10 :INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS ON CULTURAL PROPERTY The major conventions dealing with Cultural Property are:(i) The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, (also known as the Hague Convention of 1954), and its Protocol.(ii) The Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, 1970, [known as the 1970 UNESCO Convention (on Illicit Traffic) ](iii) The Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, 1972 also known as the World Heritage Convention.(iv) The Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage, 2001.(v) The UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Objects, 1995.Of the above, the 1970 Convention, commonly known as the UNESCO Convention of Illicit Trafficking is the first global legal instrument adopted for the protection of cultural heritage from theft, and more than 100 countries have ratified this convention.RETRIEVAL OF CULTURAL PROPERTY TAKEN OUT OF INDIA BEFORE INDEPENDENCEThe restitution of the cultural property taken out prior to IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Independence cannot be claimed on the ground of violation of any law. Thus, one has only to depend on the goodwill of other countries so far as their restitution is concerned. Unfortunately, such magnanimity has been shown only in rare cases by the affluent countries.: 11 :PROBLEMS IN RETRIEVALIndia is not alone in cases where its antiquities surface in the art markets of the affluent countries, in spite of existing national legislations. However, claims for their restitution cannot be made merely on the basis of their description, etc. appearing in the auction catalogues or their actual sale by individuals, unless backed by documentary proof of the authenticity and ownership of the antiquities. At most times, it is also not known how or when exactly the Indian art objects surfaced in foreign countries. The owners can always claim that they were taken out before Independence.Efforts have been made by the Archaeological Survey of India to ascertain the source of acquisition of the antiquities and art objects of Indian origin put to auction by the auction houses in foreign countries. In most cases, the auction houses have refused to divulge the source of acquisition on the pretext of business ethos and trade secrets. They have, however, assured to co-operate in restituting the cultural wealth if sufficient documentary evidence of its origin and theft or illegal export are proved.RETRIEVED ANTIQUITIES AND ART OBJECTSThe Government is taking prompt action whenever the instances of cultural wealth exported illegally have come to its notice. Some of the art objects that have been retrieved are as follows:-(i) Stucco heads from Nalanda, (Bihar)(ii) Two Sunga Pillars of 2nd Century B.C., Surajkund, Amin (Haryana)(iii) Terracota Yakshi of Tamluk, Midnapur District, West Bengal(iv) Nataraj, Tiruvilakkudi, Tanjore District Tamil Nadu(v) Nataraja Sivapuram, Tanjore District, Tamil Nadu(vi) Nataraja, Pathur, Tanjore District, Tamil Nadu(vii) Image of Buddha, Bodh Gaya, Bihar.(viii) Image of Krishnajanma, Dhubela, Chhatrapur District, Madhya Pradesh(ix) Paintings, Chandigarh Museum Chandigarh(x) Terracotta figure, Bhitargoan, Uttar Pradesh(xi) Image of Lakulisa, Jageshwar, Almora District, Uttar Pradesh(xii) Decorative Wooden Panels (7nos.), Rajasthan:12:REPATRIATION POLICY APPROVED BY THE HCM ON 7.7.2011The Indian Heritage available in the foreign countries delineates the cultural wealth having been taken abroad in two specific periods. The first comprises the heritage taken prior to IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s independence and the second encompasses artistic and traditional antiquities subjected to illicit trafficking after 1947. The restitution of cultural property taken out before IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s independence cannot be claimed in violation of any antiquarian laws enacted in independent India and one has to depend only on the goodwill of other countries so far as their retrieval is concerned. However the matter may be raised at international forums for repatriation of such cultural wealth.The repatriation of illegally exported antiquities /art treasures after independence is governed by national as well as international regulations.(A) The claim for repatriation stands upon national legislation banning unlawful export of antiquities or art treasuries vide clause 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act 1972 and supported by The Customs Act 1962 as incorporated under clause 4 of the AAT Act, 1972.(B) At international level, repatriation is facilitated under the UNESCO Convention, 1970 governing means of prohibiting and preventing illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property by the signatory member states. The said convention, under its Article 3, declares that provisions adopted by the states parties contrary to those of the said convention shall be illegal. It also provides many significant steps to be taken up by the states parties for protecting cultural properties of other countries. Article 7 (b) (ii) of the UNESCO Convention, 1970 lays down that if the state party of origin makes a request for repatriation, appropriate steps should be taken to recover and return the cultural property. The request for recovery and return shall be made through diplomatic offices. The documentation and other evidences necessary to establish the claim has to be furnished by the requesting party and all the expenses incident to the return and delivery of cultural property is borne by the requesting nation. As per existing procedure for retrieval, whenever any object is considered to be retrieved from abroad, a team of ASI representative is deputed to verify its authenticity and take over the object from the country it is retrieved. Thereafter the object is accompanied by the team under proper insurance coverage and handed over/sent to its place of origin.: 13 :NATIONAL MISSION ON MONUMENTS AND ANTIQUITIESThe National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities was formally launched by Minister (T&C) in March 2007. The outlay of Mission is Rs.90 crores for a period of five years. Documentation of the antiquities and preparation of their database is an important step in the prevention of illicit trafficking in antiquities, and in their restitution when detected. As the existing documentation is sparse and non-standard, large number of cases of antiquities smuggled abroad that face legal battles for retrieval are lost due to provenance and ownership not being established. The primary objective of the Mission is to prepare a national database on built heritage and antiquities.:23:SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONSQ 1.

These are not usual pathogens and there is no published report from India of any infection caused by such bacteria having NDM-4 gene variant. However, these have been detected in sewage near the hospital of Jawaharlal Nehru College of Aligarh Muslim University. (b) The resistance seen in multidrug resistant pathogens like NDM-4 is a naturally occurring phenomenon and is not related to rampant use of drugs . ICMR has funded many research studies which have led to better understanding of factors leading to causes and levels of development of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Indian Council of Medical Research has been funding research studies to understand the extent of microbial, host, environmental & etiological factors leading to increase in drug resistance and on development of improved diagnostics and new treatment modalities. In a study funded by ICMR, the prevalence of NDM-1 among Enterobacteriaceae in Indian medical centers was found to be as low as 2% in 2008 (19/909) and 4.5 % in 2009 (43/940).In order to strengthen the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in the country, ICMR has set up National Anti Microbial Resistance Research and Surveillance Network (AMRRSN) to enable compilation of National Data of AMR at different levels of Health Care, carry out detailed molecular studies on understanding of underlying mechanisms of resistance and understand clonality and patterns of drug resistance. ICMR has also initiated Antimicrobial Stewardship Program to provide guidance on the standard treatment practices to be followed, infection control practices and prescription practices in communities. (c) Various measures undertaken by the Ministry to address the issues includes the following:(i) A National Antibiotic Policy has been framed which provides regulatory framework around use of antibiotics in animals and humans. (ii) National Center for Disease Control (Directorate General of Health Services) has established a drug resistance surveillance network and is carrying out training and capacity building of professionals in relevant sectors and carrying out activities for dissemination of information about rational use of antibiotics. (iii) Government agencies including Indian Council of Medical Research are partnering with various scientific and professional bodies like Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Infectious Disease Society of India and Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists to initiate efforts to create awareness on drug resistance among doctors. (iv) In order to have focused regulation on manufacture and sale of antibiotics and habit forming drugs, the Drugs & Cosmetics Rule, 1945 were amended vide Gazette Notification No GSR 588 (E) dated 30.8.2013, w.e.f 1.3.14, incorporating a new schedule H1 containing 46 drugs which include 24 IIIrd & IVth generation, 11 Anti TB drugs and 11 habit forming drugs. (v) The National Programme for Containment of AMR has been initiated under 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17) with the following objectives and activities:? To establish a laboratory based surveillance system by strengthening laboratories for AMR in the country and to generate quality data on antimicrobial resistance for pathogens of public health importance.?

NIRMALA SITHARAMAN) (a) : Natural rubber (NR) prices have been generally falling from 2011 mainly due to steep fall in prices in the international market. Average price of Natural Rubber (NR) of Rubber Smoked Sheet (RSS 4 grade) declined from Rs 143.80 per kg in April 2014 to Rs 123.27 per kg in October 2014. During the same period, the price of comparable grade of NR in the international market also declined from Rs 132.56 per kg to Rs 99.85 per kg.(b) : Fall in rubber prices in domestic market is mainly due to declining trend in prices in the international market and relatively low growth in demand for specific forms of Natural Rubber. Main reasons for the fall in rubber prices in the international market are moderating demand for Natural Rubber in China, lower growth prospects of the world economy and increase in world stock of Natural Rubber. (c): With a view to protect the rubber growers from the impact of falling international prices, the Government has increased the duty on import of dry rubber from Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>20% or Rs. 20 per kg whichever is lowerÃ¢<U+0080>Â to Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>20% or Rs. 30 per kg whichever is lowerÃ¢<U+0080>Â.

Such arrangement may deprive a section of society to make a call from PCO because photo identity proof is currently not available will every citizen.

In the case of 6 States/UTs, namely, Lakshadweep, Punjab, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Jammu & Kashmir, where a minority community is in majority, a lower cut off of 15% of minority population, other than that of the minority community in majority in that State/UT has been adopted.(ii) Backward Minority concentration Towns/Cities- Towns/cities with a minimum of 25% minority population in 21 States, and in 6 States/UTs namely Lakshadweep, Punjab, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Jammu & Kashmir, 15% of minority population, other than that of the minority community in majority, having both socio-economic and basic amenities parameters below national average, have been identified as Minority Concentration Towns/Cities for implementation of the programme.(iii) Identification of Cluster of Villages- Contiguous minority concentration villages falling outside the identified Minority Concentration Blocks (having at least 50% minority population) and falling in backward districts are eligible for selection under this programme. In case of hilly areas of North Eastern States, a village cluster with 25% minority population could also be identified. States are expected to select cluster of villages for implementation of the MsDP.Based on the above criteria 710 MCBs and 66 MCTs in 27 States/UTs have been identified for implementation of MsDP during 12th Five Year Plan period. *****",208778.0
,10.03.2015,MINORITY AFFAIRS,UNSTARRED,1437.0,Dr. Bhalchandra Mungekar,Improvement of economic conditions of Muslims,"(a) whether it is a fact that the position of Muslims below poverty line has been always higher than the other religious Minorities during the years for which the information is available;(b) if so, what were the specific reasons for such situations; and(c) what special steps would the Ministry take to improve the economic conditions of the Muslim community?","MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a): The erstwhile Planning Commission used to estimate poverty from the Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. These surveys are normally conducted on quinquennial basis. The latest data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure has been collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12. In the process of collection of consumption expenditure data from households, NSSO records the religious affiliation of the household. But the NSSO consumer expenditure data is not stratified with respect to religious groups of population. As a result, Planning Commission has not estimated the poverty ratios for Muslims and the people from other minority communities living below poverty line in 2011-12. However, a High Level Committee, constituted under the Chairmanship of Justice (Retd.) Rajinder Sachar (Sachar Committee), in its report submitted to the Government in the year 2006 has indicated inter alia, that in the year 2004-05, 38.4 % of Muslims in urban areas and 26.9 % in rural areas live below the poverty level, which is higher than the other minorities.(b) The Sachar Committee Report has inter alia, observed that there is low educational achievement among the Muslim community, lack of educational facilities in the minority concentration areas, relatively higher engagement of Muslims in self employment in the unorganized sector and low participation in regular salaried jobs, which contribute to their relative backwardness.(c): The focus of the Government is to improve the educational and skill level of minority communities for their gainful employment leading to improvement in the overall condition of minorities. For welfare of minority communities, Ministry of Minority Affairs implements following programmes/ schemes:(i) Schemes for educational empowerment Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093> Ministry implements Pre-matric, Post-matric, Merit-cum-Means based scholarships and Maulana Azad National Fellowship. Under these schemes, 30% seats are earmarked for girl students. In addition, Maulana Azad Education Foundation implements a scheme exclusively for scholarship to girls belonging to minority communities. Assistance for free coaching is also provided to students for competitive examinations. A new scheme Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>Padho PardeshÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> has been launched for Interest subsidy on educational loans for minority students for their overseas studies. Another Scheme Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>Nai UdaanÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> has also been started for giving financial support to minority candidates clearing preliminary exams conducted by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), Staff Selection Commission (SSC) and State Public Service Commissions (SPSCs). Further, to strengthen educational infrastructure, construction of schools, additional classrooms and toilets are taken up under Multi-sectoral Development Programme. (ii) Scheme for economic empowerment - National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) provides for concessional loans to minorities. Ministry has also launched Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>Seekho aur Kamao (Learn & Earn)Ã¢<U+0080>Â for placement linked skill development of minorities in the year 2013-14. The scheme envisages a minimum of 75% employment of trained minority youth and out of them 50% in organized sector. A new Scheme Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>Upgradation of Skills & Training in Traditional Arts/ Crafts for Development (USTTAD)Ã¢<U+0080><U+0099> has also been approved for implementation. The scheme aims at capacity building of minority artists and craftsmen including lesser known artists/ craftsmen.(iii) Scheme for area development Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093> Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) launched in 2008-09, is the flagship programme of the Ministry to address the development deficits by creating socio-economic infrastructure and providing basic amenities in identified minority concentration areas. Digital literacy under Cybergram as one of the components of the scheme is also being implemented. (iv) Scheme for Women empowerment - Ministry started Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>Nai RoshniÃ¢<U+0080>Â, an exclusive Leadership Development Programme for Minority Women during 2012-13. The scheme aims to empower and instill confidence among minority women by providing knowledge, tools and techniques for interacting with Government systems, Banks and other institutions. ******",208942.0

NIRMALA SITHARAMAN) (a) & (b) IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s gold imports reached all time high levels of US$ 56.5 billion and US$ 53.8 billion respectively during 2011-12 and 2012-13, which led to higher trade deficit of US$ 183.4 billion and US$ 190.3 billion in 2011-12 and 2012-13 respectively. The rise in imports of gold was one of the factors contributing to India''s high trade and current account deficit in 2011-12 and 2012-13. However, as a result of the various measures taken by the Government and Reserve Bank of India, trade deficit declined from US$ 190.3 billion in 2012-13 to US$ 135.8 billion in 2013-14.The Government has also taken a number of initiatives to boost exports and reduce imports, so as to reduce trade deficit and current account deficit. The Government gradually increased customs duty on gold from 2 per cent in January 2012 to 10 per cent in August 2013. The Reserve Bank also put in place the 80:20 scheme for nominated banks/agencies/entities to rationalize the import of gold in any form/purity, including import of gold coins/dore into the country. During 2014-15 (April-January), trade deficit increased only marginally by US$ 1.8 billion to US$ 118.4 billion as against US$ 116.5 billion for the corresponding period of previous Year. The 80:20 scheme was withdrawn in November 2014. These measures have helped in reducing trade deficit and CAD in 2013-14 and subsequent quarters of 2014-15.As regards the oil prices, the monthly average crude oil prices (Indian basket) was trading at more than US$ 100 per bbl between April 2011 to August 2014. However, crude oil prices fell sharply from September 2014 and reached US$ 46.6 per bbl in January 2015. Owing to the fall in crude oil prices the oil import bill also came down, which has led to lower levels of trade deficit in the current year.(c ) & (d) Smuggling of Gold or any other commodity/item depends on the demand and supply mismatch as well as dynamic of the price differential in domestic and international price.

Sampling of Hallmarked Jewellery, which is a small part of the total jewellery sold in India, was undertaken by BIS in the months of February and March, 2015. Results from 193 samples indicate that 145 samples have passed the purity test while 48 samples have shown 0.2% average shortage of marked purity. (b) : BIS has notified a quality assurance standard (IS:1417) for gold jewellery. This standard is only a voluntary standard. Therefore, it is not incumbent on jewellers to sell gold jewellery that adheres to this standard. To encourage jewellers to sell gold jewellery that adheres to IS:1417, BIS introduced the hallmarking scheme in 2000 under which gold jewellers are encouraged to take license from BIS. This license allows jewellers to use the hallmark which is a certificate of the purity of the gold. As on 31/3/2015, 140,31 jewellers have obtained license to sell hallmarked jewellery. However, a gold jeweller who is a licensee under the scheme can display and sell both hallmarked as well as non-hallmarked jewellery as this is only a voluntary scheme. Under the scheme, a licensed jeweller is required to get his jewellery duly tested and certified in the approved Hallmarking and Assaying Centre before marking the hallmark on the jewellery. As on 31/3/2015, BIS has approved 331 Hallmarking and Assaying Centres across the country. Under the Hallmarking Scheme there is a provision for imposition of penalty on the Hallmarking and Assaying Centre and payment of compensation to the consumer by the jeweller, in case the purity of hallmarked jewellery sold is found less than the marked purity. (c) & (d) : Under the Hallmarking Scheme, no jeweller has been booked for selling impure gold hallmarked jewellery during the last three years.

As such the progress of implementation is slow in some of the State. There is no delay in achieving the targets under the Educational Empowerment Schemes. But sometimes procedural delays are noticed at State Level.Since all targets were achieved under the schemes of Nai Roshni, Seekho Aur Kamao and schemes of NMDFC, there was no delay in achieving the targets.Regular review meetings, regional and national conferences with the officials of States/UTs are held to expedite the implementation of MsDP. In addition, the officials of the Ministry of Minority Affairs visit the States to review and inspect the works of the schemes. Due emphasis is given to proper advertisement and publicity of the welfare schemes for the minorities. To ensure effective implementation of the Educational Empowerment Schemes, activity timelines are drawn up and communicated to all States/UTs and stakeholders at the beginning of each year as well as posted on the website of the Ministry. From the year 2015-16, students belonging to minority communities are required to apply for the scholarship online on a dedicated scholarship portal i.e. National Scholarship Portal (NSP) under URL: www.scholarships.gov.in and scholarships are required to be distributed through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode to the students'' bank accounts. Moreover, now the students can submit self declaration/ self certification and self attested copies of documents in respect of Religion Certificate, annual family income, marksheets etc. Periodic reviews are undertaken with State Governments/UT Administrations and BanksFor effective implementation, an Online Application & Management System is being developed under Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>Nai RoshniÃ¢<U+0080>Â scheme for transparency and efficient processing mechanism. The Ministry is in the process of developing a web application for Management Information System (MIS) and e-monitoring of Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>Seekho Aur KamaoÃ¢<U+0080>Â scheme. NMDFC has directed all its State Channelizing Agencies (SCAs) to develop MIS and upload all beneficiary data on it.

(DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD)](a) No, there has been no reduction in the Haj Pilgrimage quota allocated to Tamil Nadu between 2013-14 and 2014-15. The overall quota allocated by Government of Saudi Arabia to India is distributed between States/Union Territories in proportion to their Muslim population, as per 2001 Census. If the number of Haj Application Forms received by a State Haj Committee is less than the quota allotted to the State/Union Territory concerned, such excess quota stands surrendered to the Haj Committee of India (such States are referred to as under-quota States). These surrendered seats are redistributed among the States/Union Territories where the numbers of applications are received in excess of their allocated quota, in proportion to their Muslim population as per 2001 Census. Since 2013, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has imposed a 20% cut on foreign pilgrims undertaking Haj pilgrimage to facilitate the infrastructure being carried out around the Haram Sharif. As a result, the total number of seats allocated to India declined from 1,70,000 in 2012 to 1,36,020 in 2013. Since the reduction in quota was announced by Saudi Arabia only a few weeks before the Haj pilgrimage began in 2013, the reduction in quota was passed on to Private Tour Operators, while the Haj Committee of India retained its quota. However, for Haj 2014 and Haj 2015, the 20% cut has been imposed equally on the quota allocated to Haj Committee of India and Private Tour Operators. Thus, the Haj Committee of India has received a total quota of 100,020 seats for Haj 2014 and Haj 2015, which have been distributed between States/Union Territories. The original quota for Tamil Nadu during Haj 2013 was 2989 seats. However, after allocation of 632 surplus seats surrendered by under-quota states (such as Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand & Tripura) and 73 seats due to cancellations in under-quota states, the total number of seats utilized by Tamil Nadu went up to 3694. In 2014 and 2015, the original quota for Tamil Nadu, after the 20% cut on foreign pilgrims, was 2361 seats. However, in 2014, an additional 311 seats were allocated from surplus seats surrendered by under-quota seats and another 183 seats were allocated due to cancellations in under-quota seats, giving Tamil Nadu a total number of 2855 seats. The total number of surplus seats available have been reduced from 8559 in 2014 to 3445 in 2015, due to a decision by Haj Committee of India to clear the backlog of pilgrims who have applied for the fifth consecutive time. Therefore, 125 seats have been allocated to Tamil Nadu from surplus seats surrendered by under-quota seats and another 132 seats allocated due to cancellations in under-quota seats. So far, a total of 2618 seats have been allocated to Tamil Nadu for Haj 2015, which may increase slightly due to subsequent cancellations. The table below gives details of the original quota and allocation of additional seats:-Year Original Quota for Tamil Nadu Allocation from Surplus seats Further allocation on cancellations in under-quota states Total number of seats allocated to Tamil Nadu2013 2989 632 73 36942014 2361 311 183 28552015 2361 125 132 2618(b) There is growing demand from all over India for Haj pilgrimage and there is a demand/supply mis-match. For instance, there were 383,146 applicants from all over India for a quota of 100,020 seats in Haj 2015. There were 15,032 applicants from Tamil Nadu, out of whom 2,618 have been allocated seats for Haj 2015 on the basis of rules established by Haj Committee of India for distribution among States/UTs. Since the quota for India and other countries is fixed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the basis of 1 seat for 1000 persons of Muslim population, it is not possible for us to obtain higher quota only for India and meet the ever-growing demand.(c) There has been no reduction in allocation for Tamil Nadu or any other State/Union Territories. The 20 % cut in IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s quota imposed by Government of Saudi Arabia has been uniformly implemented for all States/Union Territories. *****",215621.0

It further noted that the IFCIÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s decision to include a condition on VRS optees to surrender their post retirement medical benefits, is violative of the Right to Equality and Right to Life, as enshrined in Articles 14 and 21 in as much as VRS optees have been discriminated not only against the employees who retired on superannuation but also the employees of IDBI who retired under their VRS. The Committee thus recommended that IFCI Ltd. may consider re-admission of VRS optees into VWS if they have or had contributed to VWF.The Committee in its 144th report (presented on 19th December 2012) recommended the Government to implement revision of pay scales and pensionary benefits with effect from 1st November, 2002 in favour of retired employees including VRS optees, who are on the pay roll of IFCI Ltd. as on 1st November, 2002 and also re-admission of VRS optees into Voluntary Welfare Scheme (VWS) if they have contributed to Voluntary Welfare Fund (VWF) for getting medical benefits.The above recommendations of the Committee were sent to IFCI for taking necessary action.IFCI has informed that the Board of Directors of IFCI Ltd. had considered the abovementioned recommendations contained in 136th report of the Committee at its meetings held on October 27, 2009; January 8, 2010; July 23, 2010; April 18, 2011; July 28, 2011; October 18, 2011 and November 1, 2011 and the Board gave earnest consideration to the recommendations keeping in view IFCIÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s status as a Company, the explicit terms and conditions of the Voluntary Retirement Schemes in question, the legal position on the subject and other related factors, the Board did not find it practical or feasible to reopen these Voluntary Retirement Schemes.While forwarding the recommendations contained in 144th report of the Committee, Department of Financial Services observed that keeping into account the provisions of VRS Scheme 2003-04, there did not appear to have any merit in the prayer of the VRS optees to claim revision in pay scale w.e.f. 01-11-2002. However, for employees who have died or retired on superannuation after 01-11-2002, the decision of IFCI appears to be unilateral and they may consider for revision in pay scale w.e.f 01-11-2002. IFCI has informed that the Board of Directors of IFCI, in its meeting held on 30th July, 2013 had decided that the benefit of revision of pay scales and allowances may be extended to employees who retired on superannuation/ Regulation 33 or expired between November 1, 2002 and October 19, 2006. Accordingly, the revision of pay scales has been extended in case of 34 such ex-employees of IFCI, who retired normally or died while in service and payment on account of differential in pension, commutation of pension, gratuity and leave encashment has been made to these 34 ex-employees in November 2013 and April 2014.******",216007.0

Both countries concluded a Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) in 1974, soon after the independence of Bangladesh, to find a solution to the complex nature of border demarcation. The agreement was implemented in its entirety with the exception of three issues pertaining to (i) undemarcated land boundary of approximately 6.1 kms in three sectors, viz. Daikhata Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093> 56 (West Bengal), Muhuri River Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093> Belonia (Tripura) and Lathitila Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093> Dumabari (Assam); (ii) exchange of 111 enclaves in Bangladesh with 51 Bangladesh enclaves in India; and (iii) adverse possessions. During the visit of the then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh to Bangladesh in September 2011, a Protocol to the 1974 LBA was signed which settled these three outstanding issues. Subsequently, Instruments of Ratification of the Agreement were exchanged on June 6, 2015 during Prime Minister Shri Narendra ModiÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s visit to Bangladesh. China China disputes the international boundary between India and China. In the eastern sector, China claims apprx. 90,000 sq. mts. of Indian territory in the state of Arunachan Pradesh.

The fact that Arunachal Pradesh and J&K are integral and inalienable parts of India has been cleary conveyed to the Chinese side on several occasions including at the highest level.India and China, under the agreement on Confidence Building Measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas, signed in November 1996 and subsequent protocol on modalities for the implementation of Confidence Building Measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas, signed in April 2005 and Border Defence Cooperation Agreement, signed in October 2013, are committed to the clarification and confirmation of the Line of Actual Control to reach a common understanding of the alignement of the Line of Actual Control.The two sides have agreed to each appoint a Special Representative (SR) to explore the framework for a boundary settlement from the political perspective of the overall bilateral relationship. The 18th round of special representatives talks on the India-China boundary question was held in New Delhi from March 22-24, 2015.India and China have established a Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China Border Affairs to deal with important border affairs related to maintaining peace and tranquility in the India-China borders areas. A meeting of WMCC was held in Beijing on 8 October, 2015. India and China are committed to resolve bilateral issues through dialogue and peaceful negotiations and in a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable manner.Myanmar There is no boundary dispute between India and Myanmar.There are nine unresolved Boundary Pillars (BPs) along the India-Myanmar Border in the Manipur sector. Regular dialogue is held between India and Myanmar on issues related with boundary demarcation and border management, through institutionalised mechanisms such as Foreign Office Consultations, National Level Meetings (NLM), Sectoral Level Meetings (SLM) and Heads of Survey Department meeting.Nepal Boundary strip maps covering 98% of the India-Nepal boundary have been authenticated and initialed in 2007 at the Surveyor-General level, though they are yet to be signed at the plenipotentiary level. Issues relating to the maintenance and management of the India-Nepal boundary are discussed in existing bilateral mechanisms at both senior official and working levels. Our unique, centuries-old civilizational ties with Nepal, based on shared geography, history, culture, language and religion and characterized by close political relations, wide-ranging economic cooperation and deep-rooted people-to-people friendship, have been rejuvenated since May 2014 with sustained interaction at the highest political level, including HonÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ble Prime MinisterÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s two visits to Nepal in 2014. The India-Nepal Joint Commission was revived at the level of External Affairs Minister in July 2014. India continues to maintain close engagement and bilateral exchanges with Nepal, as well as extend all assistance in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Nepal, for peace, stability and socio-economic development of the countryPakistan India is willing to address all outstanding bilateral issues with Pakistan through bilateral peaceful means. However, continued support by Pakistan to terrorism directed at us from the territory under PakistanÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s control has prevented creation of necessary environment. Government has urged Pakistan on several occasions to fulfil its assurances, given and reiterated at the highest level, to put an end to anti-India activities on its soil and territories under its control.Sri Lanka There is no border dispute between India and Sri Lanka",216300.0

To further prevent this negligible tilt, the entire base of Qutub Minar was water tightened to ensure that water does not percolate into the foundation of the monument.(c) & (d) Yes Sir, some architectural members of Hindu and Jain Temple were found during the course of conservation & scientific clearance. Some of these members are on display in the Qutub Complex and the rest are kept in safe custody within the same complex.(e) No excavation has been carried out in Qutub Complex.

The technology for community scale RO desalination plants has been developed. The RO plants in various states (Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, West Bengal, Gujarat etc.) have been set up based on the technology. Further, technology for arsenic removal from water has been developed and based on the same common people have benefitted in the state of West Bengal. Also high flux hollow fibre membrane based technology for water disinfection and purification at affordable cost has been developed and is being used at commercial level.CSIR has developed KrishiShakti, a small range (11.2 hp) diesel engine tractor. The technology of the same has been transferred and manufacturing has been initiated in West Bengal. The tractor was launched in Delhi on 20th November 2014. During the launch five tractors were handed over to farmers. The KrishiShakti has enabled farmers with small land holdings for effective tilling.A cost effective and efficient anti tarnishing lacquer has been developed for brasswares, helping the Moradabad brass cluster. The developed lacquer is very efficient to prevent tarnishing for long durations. Also, energy efficient brass melting furnace has been developed which is smoke-free coal furnace, handles more charge (brass melt), reduces gas emission and pollution by 80% and consumes 20% less coal. It is user friendly as artisans can adopt this furnace without changing their current practices and like the present furnace, this modified version can also be repaired by the artisans. The knowhow has been transferred for commercial use.CSIR has developed an indigenous substitute of Ukraine clay in granito ceramic tiles which has reduced the Ukraine clay requirement from 20% to about 1%, reducing thus the foreign material import and associated costs. This has made major economic difference and benefitted small and medium scale enterprises in Gujarat.A food processing unit has been set up at CSIR-Centre for High Altitude Biology (CSIR-CeHAB) in the remote tribal region of Lahaul and Spiti.

The knowhow was showcased at the District level Tribal Fair at Keylong and training organized for the benefit of progressive farmers in the area of food and food processing: making novel products from Buckwheat; and also brining of the peas which is a major crop.CSIR has worked with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for the development of highly priced rice variety, Samba Mahsuri, resistant to the serious Bacterial Blight (BB) disease. This new variety called, improved Samba Mahsuri has been released for commercial cultivation and is being very much appreciated by farmers growing rice.CSIR in collaboration with Rice Research Station, Chinsurah, West Bengal has developed novel low grain arsenic accumulating rice genotype. The variety which is named as Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>MuktashreeÃ¢<U+0080>Â will be soon released for cultivation in vast arsenic affected belts of West Bengal.A novel variety of Ashwagandha with high root yield of 15 quintal/hectare has been developed and released to farmers which would help farmers with more earnings. The Ashwagandha has useful applications in pharma applications as anti-inflammatory, anti-stroke and anti-arthritis drug adjuvant.CSIR has developed a new variety Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>CIM-JyotiÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> of Ocimum through intensive breeding efforts for high yield of herb and essential oil with desirable quality of higher citral (68-75%). This variety will produce citral in a short duration of 70-80 days. It also fits in crop rotation/intercropping between wheat and paddy and with other vegetable crops of small farmers. Leaves of this variety can also be used in lemon tea.The people of North East India make a number of leather products but they were unable to reach the market and earn desired profit due to lack of aesthetic appeal and standardisation. There was a need to transform this knowledge into wealth by increasing the value of the products without losing its real essence. CSIR carried out a comprehensive survey in the north eastern region. Based on the inputs from the survey, new ranges of products were developed. The handbags are crafted and designed with the ethnic materials of the northeast and the inspirations are derived from Ornaments, Dresses & Artifacts adorned by tribal folks of the northeast India. The products were displayed in various national/ international fairs and have attracted many enquiries. This has benefited the women entrepreneurs of North Eastern region.CSIR has set up post-harvest centres in Mizoram (Aizawl) and Arunachal Pradesh (Pashighat). These centres are focused at helping the local farmers in the region for value addition to their agricultural produce. The centres house technology for high efficiency drying and processing of ginger, cardamom, turmeric, chilies etc. The farmers are able to sell their produce at 20 Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093> 25% higher price to the processing centres set up. The CSIR Post Harvest Technology Centres would generate direct employment to about 300 people.CSIR has introduced and commercialized Lilium cultivation in Lahaul and Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh. CSIR has played a catalytic role in the promotion of commercial floriculture in Himachal Pradesh. The transfer of agrotechnologyofLilium in the region was realized by the flower growers through sale of cut flowers at Delhi flower market. Over 3000 farmers are engaged in floriculture in Himachal Pradesh.CSIR has developed knowhow for easy cultivation of economically important seaweed, namely Kappaphycusalvarezii, which was disseminated to the fishing community in coastal regions of Tamil Nadu as supplementary activity to existing fishing activities. Presently, more than eight hundred Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are engaged in seaweed farming in the region. It provides a regular and sustainable income source for women, with each of them earning on an average Rs. 5000/- per month for a period of eight months in a year. CSIR has further developed integrated process for simultaneous recovery of two products from the harvested fresh seaweed, namely, hydrocolloid of commercial use and liquid biofertilizer for use by farmers.CSIR has been adopting villages to promote employment generation and income augmentation. It has thus catalyzed commercial cultivation of Geranium in Uttaranchal and Lavender in Jammu & Kashmir through community participation. In these end to end missions, farmers have been trained not only for cultivation of Geranium and Lavender but also for extraction of oil, augmenting thus their income. Likewise CSIR efforts through development of niche Mentha varieties and their propagation for mass cultivation are noteworthy. The efforts have led to economic growth and have enabled India to acquire a world leadership position in Menthol mint oil production and export.CSIR efforts for socio-economic development had led to: empowering people of the Kashmir Valley through creation of aromatic plant industry; development of bio-inoculants for enhancing plant productivity and its dissemination to the farmers in Uttar Pradesh in the partnership with the State Government on a very large scale and it has enhanced agriculture productivity; and development of mushroom technology, its transfer and training which has benefitted economically the rural women in North East States. CSIR has also launched the Jammu Aroma Arogya Gram (JAAG) Yojana for deployment of CSIR agri-technologies and handholding the farmers of J&K for cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants in the state.CSIR has been contributing in the area of healthcare. Some recently developed technologies/interventions benefitting the common people include: Streptokinase (a drug for cardiovascular disease); Risorine (a cost effective bioavailability enhanced anti-tuberculosis drug); Battery operated hand-held MicroPCR (towards affordable and point of care disease diagnostics for Tuberculosis, Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Hepatitis B and H1N1); nonClonableID technology for medical product authentication; Diagnostic system for affordable, point of need testing to manage HIV and TB; Novel molecular diagnostics for eye diseases; and e-Health Center (eHC, a platform for the fourth paradigm of science, data-intensive discovery, while bringing affordable healthcare services to the doorstep of people). CSIR has recently developed a novel, safe poly-herbal formulation BGR-34 as a safe hypoglycaemic agent for management of diabetes conditions which has recently been commercialized by an industry.CSIR has played a major role in protecting the traditional knowledge by creating a Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). The TKDL contains information in 5 international languages, i.e. English, Japanese, Spanish, French and German concerning 2.93 lakh medicinal formulations in Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Through the TKDL access agreement concluded with European Patent Office (EPO, 34 Member States), US Patent & Trade Mark Office (USPTO), Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), IP Australia, Japan Patent Office (JPO), United Kingdom Patent and Trademark Office (UKPTO), German Patent Office (GPO), Chile Patent Office and Malaysian Patent Office, examiners of these offices can utilize TKDL for search and examination of Intellectual Property applications filed but cannot make any third party disclosure. TKDL is recognized globally as a model for protection of traditional knowledge.Annexure-IIS. No. Name of Nodal Laboratory and location Title of the Project1.

Apart from other possible factors, the call drop is more likely in the places where the number of active mobile service users,at a given location and time of the day, is relatively large.In urban settlements such as prominent business districts, important public buildings and civil facilities centres, business hubs, transportation centers and commercial markets may witness higher number of active mobile users especially during the peak business hours. Besides, the other related factors such as mobility of user while making a call, high-rise structures and limited open space in urban areas increase the likelihood of experiencing the call drop by some of the mobile users. On the other side, the call drop may be less frequent in the settlement areas with lower user-density and plenty of open space such as rural settlements and agricultural fields. However, high density of mobile users on the occasion of any social or religious festivities at a given location may result in relatively higher incidences of call drops during that interval. In order to monitor the status of mobile services, Quality of Service parameters have been prescribed and notified by TRAI from time to time. All such prescribed parameters are common to metro, urban as well as rural areas across the country. In view of reported instances of call drops in different parts of India,TRAI has prescribed more stringent financial disincentives in the event of consistent failure for not meeting the prescribed QoS benchmarks by any of the cellular mobile service provider. TRAI, after consulting the stake holders, has also enacted the Telecom Consumer Protection (Ninth Amendment) Regulations, 2015 dated 16th October, which came into force on 1st January, 2016. As provided in the Regulations, maximum of 3 call drops per day per subscriber are required to be compensated in favour of the caller by the related service provider at the rate of Rs. 1 per call drop in the given Service Area. However, some of the telecommunications service providers and Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) challenged the TRAI Regulations dated 16th October, 2015 in Delhi High Court. The High Court vide its judgment dated 29th February, 2016 has upheld the said Regulations effective from 1st January 2016 onwards. However, an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Delhi has been filed before the Supreme Court of India by the association of these companies. The Supreme Court has not granted any interim stay so far. Besides, the Department is actively coordinating to improve upon the current status of call drops by involving concerned government agencies such as New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), Directorate of Estates, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) and Security agencies as well as State Governments for granting permission for deployment of additional sites. Ministry of Urban Development and Department of Posts has in-principle agreed to permit installation of in-building solutions / mobile towers on buildings under their control. Further, the Department as well as TRAI has been spreading the awareness amongst the general public and mobile users that the radio emissions from telecommunications equipments have no potential health hazards. The Department of Telecommunications has finalised lot of policy initiatives to facilitate operations. Spectrum Sharing and Trading policies pending for so many years have been finalised. Sharing of infrastructure among operators including tower and active infrastructure has been permitted. The Department has been taking pro-active steps in monitoring and improving the situation. Sustained communications has been done regarding misgivings about radiations. Steps have also been taken at the National and State levels to facilitate Right of Way issues. (c) In reference to call drop rate measured for BSNL vis a vis private cellular operators, the performance of BSNL is comparable with the performance of private operators. In order to reduce call drops, BSNL as well as private cellular operators have added number of new mobile service sites.

A press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan (MFA) on April 06, 2016 mentioned, inter alia, that the visit of the JIT to India had taken place in the context of the cooperative approach being pursued by the Government of Pakistan to effectively fight terrorism in all its forms. In his press briefings on April 07 and 14, 2016, the MFA Spokesperson stated that it would be appropriate to allow the investigations to take their course rather than indulge in speculations, and that the JIT was evaluating the information shared by the Indian side. Mr. Sartaj Aziz, the Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister of Pakistan in his interview to an Indian TV channel on April 18 reiterated similar views.The Pathankot Air Base attack has served to stress once again the centrality of our concern regarding cross-border terrorism in our relationship with Pakistan. The need for Pakistan to effectively address this aspect has been reiterated several times to Pakistan, including at the highest level. Guided by the vision to work towards a peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood, the Government has taken initiatives to build normal relationship with all our neighbours, including Pakistan. Prime Minister of Pakistan was invited to the swearing-in ceremony of the Union Council of Ministers on May 26, 2014. Since then, the Prime Ministers of the two countries have been in touch. They met on 10 July 2015 on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Ufa, Russia, and on 30 November 2015 on the margins of the Climate Change Summit in Paris. At Ufa, the two leaders mandated various steps to restore normalcy on the International Border and the Line of Control, including meeting of National Security Advisors (NSAs) and meeting of Directors General of Border Security Force and Pakistani Rangers, which took place last year. In the first such meeting, the two NSAs met in Bangkok on December 6, 2015 and held constructive discussions on peace and security, terrorism, tranquility along the Line of Control and Jammu & Kashmir, the State which is worst hit from terrorism and violence across LOC. External Affairs Minister called on the Prime Minister of Pakistan and met Mr. Sartaj Aziz on December 9, 2015 in Islamabad where she had traveled for attending the Ministerial Conference of the Heart of Asia Process on Afghanistan. In light of the constructive discussions between NSAs in Bangkok, PakistanÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to effectively combat all forms of terrorism and the assurances to expedite Mumbai attack trial in Pakistan, both sides agreed on a Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue and tasked the Foreign Secretaries to work out its modalities. Prime MinisterÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s brief stop over in Lahore on December 25, 2015 was after his telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Pakistan when he called Mr. Nawaz Sharif from Kabul, where Prime Minister was on a visit, to wish him on his birthday and was informed of a wedding in Mr. SharifÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s family. The visit underscored our vision for a normal and connected neighbourhood.Both sides have remained engaged in the aftermath to the Pathankot attack, including for the visit of Pakistan''s JIT in the context of investigation into the attack. The two Prime Ministers have spoken to each other on a few occasions, including on January 5, 2016 when Prime Minister of Pakistan called Prime Minister and assured full investigation and effective action regarding the Pathankot attack. On 10 April 2016, Mr. Nawaz Sharif called Prime Minister to condole loss of life in the Kerala temple fire. Prime Minister had called Prime Minister Sharif on March 27, 2016 after the Lahore terrorist attack. The two NSAs and Foreign Secretaries have also remained in touch. EAMÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s meeting with Mr. Sartaj Aziz in Pokhara on March 17, 2016 on the sidelines of the SAARC Ministerial Council Meeting helped pave the way for the visit of PakistanÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s JIT.In light of the decisions taken during the Ufa meeting of the two leaders Pakistan has released and returned so far 335 Indian fishermen and 57 boats from its custody. India has also released and repatriated all those Pakistani fishermen whose nationality had been verified by Pakistani authorities.",221885.0

,11.05.2016,COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  ,UNSTARRED ,1944.0,Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar,Non utilization of domestic stock due to excess import of natural rubber,"(a) the year-wise quantum of natural rubber imported and produced in the last three years;(b) whether there has been excess import of natural rubber leading to non-utilization of domestic stock;(c) whether Government has studied the ramifications of the Indo-ASEAN agreement on the prices of plantation crops, especially rubber, on the rubber plantation farmers in Kerala;(d) if so, the details thereof; and (e) the steps taken by Government to address the falling prices of natural rubber, including compensating the rubber farmers of Kerala for the losses accrued due to drop in rubber prices?","THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SMT. NIRMALA SITHARAMAN) *****(a) : Year-wise statistics of Natural Rubber (NR) imported and produced in the last three years are given as under:-NR import and Production (Tonne)Year Import Production2013-14 360263 7740002014-15 442130 6450002015-16 (provisional) 454303 563000(b): Provisional estimates of NR production and consumption during 2015-16 indicated a consumption-production balance of 424,540 tonnes. Import of NR during 2015-16 was 454,303 tonnes. However, the stock of NR declined from 252,000 tonne as at the end of March 2015 to 224,000 tonnes at the end of March 2016. The consumption-production balance and stock of NR do not indicate considerable excess import of NR leading to non-utilisation of stock.(c) & (d): Tariff lines pertaining to NR are included in the Exclusion List of Indo-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.

In the process of collection of consumption expenditure data from households, NSSO records the religious affiliation of the households. But the NSSO consumer expenditure data is not stratified with respect to religious groups of population. As a result, Planning Commission has not estimated the poverty ratios for Muslims and the people from other minority communities living belowpoverty line or below double the poverty line in 2011-12.Further, the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) is collecting Below Poverty Line (BPL) data in respect of rural areas and has launched a Socio EconomicCaste Census (SECC) in 2011 to identify households with specific socio-economic characteristics in rural and urban areas of the country.

The extension of Mid-day meal scheme, in the blocks with concentration of minority population as well as the children in Madarsas, has affirmed a positive educational, nutritional and social impact of the Scheme. This has increased enrolment of Muslim children, including girls in primary and upper primary level of education.ii.

The impact of SGSY on the beneficiaries was not only visible in their living standard but also in other behavioural aspects like consumption pattern, savingbehaviour and increased accessibility to different amenities, like schooling, drinking water, sanitary latrine, electricity etc.vi. The Evaluation study, conducted in respect of IAY, shows that its impact on beneficiaries? life, livelihood and well being was manifold. IAY has ushered in new life style with improved standard of living. The beneficiaries had access to health care services and banking facilities after securing the IAY house. The concerted efforts of the Government of India, in improving the educational empowerment of minorities, especially Muslims, also show that the literacy rate of Muslims, considered laggards in terms of education, has increased from 59.1% (as per Census 2001) to 68.5% (as per Census 2011). ******Annexure-I referred to in reply to parts (c) & (d) of the Rajya Sabha Unstarred Question No. 276 to be answered on 19.07.2016 asked by Shrimati Renuka Chowdhury regarding Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>BPL Minority CommunitiesÃ¢<U+0080>ÂDetails of schemes / initiatives for the welfare Of minorities are as under:i.

SARVA SHIKSHA ABHIYAN (SSA) The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is Government of India''s flagship programme for achievement of Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) in a time bound manner, as mandated by the 86th Amendment to the Constitution of India making Free and Compulsory Elementary Education to the Children of 6-14 years age group, a Fundamental Right. With the notification of Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, SSA has been harmonized to meet RTE Act mandate. SSA is implemented in all schools except private unaided schools. Even private unaided schools have an obligation for admitting 25% children belonging to disadvantaged groups under section 12(1) (c) of RTE Act 2009 and hence, the coverage of SSA is universal. Among 28 States/UTs notifying admission, 18 States/UTs have reported actual admission of children in private schools under Section 12(1) (c) during 2014-15. A total of 18.49 lakh children are studying in private schools under Section 12(1) (c) during 2014-15. 07 states have started reimbursement of fees to private schools. SSA covered about 19.77 crore children in 14.46 lakh schools throughout the country in the year 2014-15. SSA is implemented in partnership with the States/UTs, with revised funding pattern. SSA funds now will be shared in the ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and the States and 90:10 for the 08 North Eastern States and 03 Himalayan States. SSA provides for opening of new schools in habitations not having access to schooling facilities, residential schools for girls and strengthening of existing school infrastructure with additional classrooms, toilets, drinking water, ramps, library, computers, child entitlements like supply of text books, uniforms etc. It also sanctions additional teachers, organizes pre-service, in-service teacher training, besides providing various grants for school maintenance, development, teaching learning equipment/ materials etc. 2. MID DAY MEAL Scheme (MDMS) National Progarmme for Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE), commonly known as Mid-Day-Meal Scheme (MDMS), was launched as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 1995. MDMS was extended to upper primary (classes VI to VIII) children in 3,479 Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) in October 2007. The Scheme was extended during 2008-09 to cover children of upper primary classes and the name of the Scheme was changed as ''National Programme of Mid-Day Meal in Schools''. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme covers all school children studying in I-VIII classes in Government and Government Aided Schools, Special Training Centers (STC) and Madrasas & Maqtabs supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Schools are also covered at primary stage from 1st April, 2010. MDMS is managed and implemented by School Management Committees (SMCs)/Village Education Committees (VECs), Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), and Self Help Groups (SHGs). MDMS has been progressively revised, restructured and universalized at elementary level to provide hot cooked meals to children. It is not contractor driven and engages about 25.71 lakhs cook-cum helpers by States/UTs of which 80% are women. MHRD has already approved the engagement of 28.29 lakhs cook-cum helpers. MDMS is implemented in partnership with the States/UTs, with revised funding pattern. MDMS funds now will be shared in the ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and the States and 90:10 for the 08 North Eastern States and 03 Himalayan States. MDMS is an integral part of National Food Security Legislation. During 2013-14, 10.80 crore children studying in 11.58 lakh schools/ Institutions have been benefitted from the MDMS Scheme across the country.Fostering social equality MDMS is helping spread egalitarian values, as children from various social backgrounds learn to sit together and share a common meal. In particular, MDMS can help to break the barriers of caste and class among school children. Appointing cooks from SC/ST communities is another way of teaching children to overcome caste prejudices.3. Scheme for Providing Education in Madrassas/ Minorities (SPQEM) SPQEM seeks to bring about qualitative improvement in Madrassas to enable Muslim children attain standards of the national education system in formal education subjects. The important salient features of SPQEM scheme are: (i) to strengthen capacities in Madrassas for teaching of the formal curriculum subjects like Science, Mathematics, Language, Social Studies etc. through enhanced payment of teacher honorarium; (ii) providing science labs, computer labs with annual maintenance costs in the secondary and higher secondary stage Madrassas; (iii) provision of Science. mathematics kits in primary/upper primary level Madrassas; (iv) strengthening of libraries/book banks and providing teaching learning materials at all levels of Madrassas; etc. 4. Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) The vision of the scheme is to provide good quality, accessible secondary education to all young children in the age group of 15-16 years. The major objectives of the RMSA are to: (i) raise the minimum level of education to class X and universalize access to secondary education; (ii) ensure good-quality secondary education with focus on Science, Mathematics and English; and (iii) reduce the gender, social and regional gaps in enrolments, dropouts and improving retention. Important equity interventions provided in the scheme are (i) special focus on micro planning; (ii) preference to Ashram schools for upgradation; (iii) preference to areas with concentration of SC/ST/Minority for opening of schools; (iv) special enrolment drive for the weaker sections; (v) more female teachers in schools; and (vi) separate toilet blocks for girls. The funding pattern under RMSA in respect of noral States is 75:25 and in case of North Eastern States it is 90:105. Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) KGBV are residential upper primary schools for girls from SC, ST, OBC Muslim communities and BPL girls. KGBVs are set up in educational backward blocks where schools are at great distances and are a challenge to the security of girls. This often compels girls to discontinue their education. KGBVs provide for a minimum reservation of 75% seats for girls from SC/ST/OBC and minorities communities and 25% to girls from families that live below the poverty line.

The identification of Special Focus Districts (SFDs) is an important step in the direction of providing universal and quality education to SCs, STs & Muslim students at the elementary level. During 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, 42.8%, 49% and 48% of the funds under SSA respectively were targeted to SFDs.The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) was launched in the year 2009 with an aim to universalize access to secondary schools by providing a secondary school within a reasonable distance (5 kilometers) of every habitation, improving quality of education through making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms and through removal of gender, socio-economic and disability barriers with special focus on SC, ST and Minority students, as well as hilly and difficult areas. Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to the States and UTs for opening of new Government secondary schools and school infrastructure including an Integrated Science Laboratory, Library, Art and Craft Room. The State/UT-wise details of funds released for the last two years and current year under RMSA are at Annexure-I.

Therefore, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has brought out specific guidelines on prevention and control of pollution in rivers and other water bodies from idol immersion. These guidelines prescribe that the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) conduct water quality assessment of the water body before and after immersions, post the data on internet and help local administration in preparing material for mass awareness for the purpose. Further, the guidelines prescribe that idols be made from natural materials like traditional clay, water soluble and non-toxic natural dyes be used for painting of idols, worship material like flowers, clothes, decorating material (made of paper and plastic) be removed before immersion of idols, biodegradable materials collected separately for recycling or composting, non-biodegradable materials disposed off in sanitary landfills, immersion of idols in river be done at identified idol immersion spots along the river bank in temporary ponds having earthen bunds with removable synthetic liners at bottom, etc. The guidelines have been circulated to all States and Union Territories for implementation.The Government has also notified the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, wherein the ambit of the rules has been expanded beyond municipal/notified areas to inter alia include places of pilgrimage, religious and historical importance.

J. AKBAR)(a) & (b) IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Look East Policy (LEP) has been a major pillar of our foreign policy since the early 1990s. In the second half of 2014, LEP was upgraded to Act East Policy which focuses on the extended neighbourhood in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy which was originally conceived as an economic initiative, has gained political, strategic and cultural dimensions including establishment of institutional mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation. The key principles and objectives of ''''Act East PolicyÃ¢<U+0080>Â is to promote economic cooperation, cultural ties and develop strategic relationship with countries in the Asia-Pacific region through continuous engagement at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels thereby providing enhanced connectivity to the States of North Eastern Region with other countries in our neighbourhood.

Thus we now have strategic partnership with Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, Singapore and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forged close ties with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Further, apart from ASEAN, ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit (EAS), we have also been actively engaged in regional fora such as Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), Mekong Ganga Cooperation (MGC) and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). A Line of Credit of US $ 1 billion has been offered by our Prime Minister at the ASEAN-India Summit for enhancing physical and digital connectivity between India and ASEAN.

Hence there is no massive gap in GER of boys and girls at secondary and senior secondary level in the country. In case of higher education, GER of girls is marginally lower than that of boys at all India level and also in respect of most of the States. A statement showing , State-wise, Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of boys and girls at secondary, senior secondary and higher education levels in the country for 2015-16 is annexed. Lower GER of girls in higher education as compared to that of boys could be attributed to factors such as social, cultural and religious beliefs, attitudes and practices, poverty and poor learning environment.Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), universalisation of secondary education envisages enhancing the enrollment ratio by providing a secondary school within a reasonable distance of every habitation, improving quality of education imparted at secondary level through making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms, removal of gender, socio-economic and disability barriers. The scheme provides for classrooms, science laboratory, library, computer room, art/craft/culture room, toilets, drinking water facilities etc. in new/upgradation and existing secondary schools. Further, interventions like survey and identification of out of school children, awareness programmes, remedial teaching for learning enhancement, self-defence training for girls, provision of girls toilets, introduction of vocational education at Secondary stage, etc. have also been supported under RMSA to improve access to school education. In order to encourage girls students for pursuing higher education, the Government is implementing scholarship/fellowship programmes for them to supplement the cost of education.

Four rounds of National Achievement Survey (NAS) have been conducted so far for grade V and three rounds for classes III & VIII. These reveal improvement in learning achievement levels of pupils, in identified subjects from first round to fourth round. Since only first round of NAS has been conducted at class X level, it is not possible to comment on the comparative learning achievement or decline of students of Grade X. The Central Government implements Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) for improvement of elementary and secondary education, respectively. Under SSA, the State Governments and UT Administrations are supported on several interventions to improve teaching standards, including regular in-service teachersÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> training, induction training for newly recruited teachers, training of all untrained teachers to acquire professional qualifications through Open Distance Learning (ODL) mode, recruitment of additional teachers for improving pupil-teacher ratios, academic support for teachers through block and cluster resource centres, continuous and comprehensive evaluation system to equip the teacher to measure pupil performance and provide remedial action wherever required, and teacher and school grants for development of appropriate teaching-learning materials, etc. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 specifies statutory duties and responsibilities of teachers and lays down the minimum qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as a teacher in elementary schools. For the year 2016-17, 10% of the funds under SSA have been clearly earmarked for quality interventions. Recently, the Central Government has notified Learning Outcomes for all elementary classes which will help teachers and parents to benchmark learning levels of students. Additionally, the States & UTs are supported for early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme of SSA namely Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>Padhe Bharat Badhe BharatÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> (PBBB) in classes I and II. Further the Government has launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, inter alia, as a sub-component of SSA and RMSA, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities. In order to provide quality education to students at the secondary level, various interventions are funded under the RMSA, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme. These include provision for : (i) additional teachers to improve Pupil Teacher Ratio, (ii) induction and in-service training for Principals, Teachers , Master Trainers and Key Resource Persons, (iii) Maths and Science kits, (iv) Lab equipments, (v) Special teaching for learning enhancement, (vi) ICT facilities in schools, (vii) introduction of vocational education component at the secondary level. Further, for improving the quality of school education, the School Standards & Evaluation framework, known as Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>Shaala SiddhiÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> has been developed by NUEPA, to enable schools to evaluate their performance in a more focused and strategic manner and to facilitate them to make professional judgments for improvement. (b) & (c): The Right of Children to free and Compulsory Education (RTE), Act 2009 provides free education to all the children between the age group of 6-14 years irrespective of caste, religion or area. To ensure access to children, all the States and UTs have notified area or limits of their neighbourhood norms, factoring in their state specific conditions, for opening of schools in accordance with the Central Rules. Under SSA, provisions have also been made for residential schools/hostels for example Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs), which are residential schools for girls at upper primary level, have also been sanctioned to the States for improving access to marginalised girls particularly out of school, either drop out or never enrolled and transportation/ escort facility for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection. Special training is also provided to all such children who are school dropouts and long absentees. Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 provides for admission of children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood private unaided schools in Class I or below to the extent of at least 25 percent of the strength of that class. For improving the access of all students, including students from ST community at the secondary level of schooling, RMSA provides for new secondary schools and by provisioning for additional classrooms, science laboratory, library, computer rooms, art/craft/culture rooms, toilets, drinking water facilities etc. in the new secondary schools and existing secondary schools.

Ministry has urged the foreign governments to take a humane approach and to send the children back to India so that they can be brought up in their own ethnic, religious, cultural, spiritual and linguistic miliu and social environment.

This report assesses the progress made in the implementation of UNHRC resolution 30/1, on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka between October 2015 and January 2017. On that basis, the HCHR has identified efforts that need to be taken to achieve progress in the reconciliation and accountability agenda to which the Government of Sri Lanka has committed by agreeing to be the co-sponsor of the resolution that is tabled before the UNHRC. The HCHR also advocates for the Government of Sri Lanka to continue meaningful consultations with relevant stakeholders on transitional justice and the reform agenda, and urges the UNHRC to sustain its close engagement and monitoring of developments in Sri Lanka.IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s approach in the UN Human Rights Council has been guided by the firm belief that promotion and protection of human rights can be best pursued through constructive and collaborative engagement. We also believe in the primacy of national efforts in the realisation of human rights. In keeping with its traditional commitment to human rights and values, India has actively participated in all sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, in a constructive and inclusive manner.As Sri LankaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s closest neighbour, India cannot remain untouched by developments in that country. India has always supported efforts to preserve Sri LankaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s character as a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious society in which all citizens, including the Sri Lankan Tamil community, can live in equality, safety and harmony, and prosper and fulfil their aspirations within a united Sri Lanka. We hope that with the sagacity and political will of its leadership and the support of its people, Sri Lanka will achieve genuine reconciliation and development. The Government has consistently called upon Sri Lanka during bilateral discussions and in the international fora to fulfill its commitments made to the international community on addressing the issues related to protecting the interest of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Since the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka, the focus of Government of India has been on the welfare and well-being of the Tamil citizens of Sri Lanka. In this context, the Government has implemented and continues to implement a wide range of projects covering assistance projects for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the areas of housing, de-mining, education, connectivity, livelihood restoration, economic revival etc.",233880.0

Consequently, SSA attempts to reach out to girls and children belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Muslims and other marginalised communities. SSA has also given attention to urban deprived children, children affected by periodic migration, and children living in remote and scattered habitations. Under the SSA, the districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs). The criteria for identifying the SFDs in case of SCs and STs is a population of 25% and above, while for Muslims, it is 20% and above population. SFDs also include 121 districts identified by Ministry of Minority Affairs to monitor implementation of SSA as part of Prime MinisterÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 15 Point Programme and 88 districts identified by Ministry of Home Affairs as districts affected with Left Wing Extremism (LWE).Through the interventions made under SSA in SFDs, at the national level the enrolment share of SC children as per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), 2015-16, at primary and upper primary level is 19.94% and 19.49% respectively, whereas their share in population is 16.6% (as per Census 2011).

Participation of students at school has an impact on their learning outcomes. Four rounds of National Achievement Surveys (NAS) have been conducted so far by the National Council of Educational Research & Training for class V whereas three rounds have been conducted for classes III & VIII. As per the findings of the surveys of Round 4 for class V and Round 3 for class III & VIII, the SC/ST children have performed better than the national average in Language, Maths, Science and Social Science, in many of the States. (c): A total of 323 districts under one or more of the above categories have been identified as SFDs under SSA.(d): Under SSA, since its inception upto 31.12.2016, 99365 primary schools, 62670 upper primary schools and 954621 additional classrooms have been constructed in SFDs.

So far, the National inventory constitutes a list of 165 ICH elements of the country. The list of elements is annexed as Annexure-A.In addition to this, as part of the Convention on ICH, UNESCO also maintains a Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity made up of those intangible heritage elements that help demonstrate the diversity of this heritage and raise awareness about its importance.
