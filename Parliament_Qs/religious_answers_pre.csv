D. PURANDESWARI) (a to d): The Central Universities being autonomous bodies established and incorporated under the Acts of Parliament, the Central Government has no control over their day-to-day functioning. However, the President of India, in the capacity as the Visitor of these Universities, has the right to cause an inquiry to be made in respect of any matter connected with the administration or finances of a University. The University Grants Commission (UGC), which is mandated to maintain standards of higher education in the country and to allocate and disburse grants to the Central Universities, may also look into the allegations/complaints against the Central Universities. During the last three years, the Visitor/UGC has constituted Fact Finding Committees to look into the allegations/complaints relating, inter- alia, to financial mismanagement, misappropriation of funds, irregularities in appointments, violation of Statutes and Ordinances, personal charges against Statutory Officers, etc. against the Vice Chancellors and other officials of Nagaland University, Aligarh Muslim University and Visva-Bharati. Besides, the Central Vigilance Commission has instituted a fact finding inquiry into certain complaints against the Indira Gandhi National Open University. The various allegations contained in the representation made to the President, in her capacity as the Visitor of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), by 18 Members of Parliament, were the subject matter of other complaints received in the Ministry â<U+0080><U+0093> these included the alleged irregularities in the matter of appointment to the various posts, particularly those in AJ Kidwai Mass Communication Research Centre (AJKMCRC), statutory violations, award of honorary degrees without obtaining the prior approval of the Visitor, during the tenure of the former Vice Chancellor. All these complaints, together with the then Vice Chancellorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s comments and this Ministryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s observations thereon, were placed before the Visitor. It was felt that the allegations were yet to be proved. Meanwhile, following disagreement between the Selection Committee and the Executive Council in the matter of appointment to the post of Lecturer (Still Photography) in AJKMCRC, this Ministry is in the process of submitting the case to the Visitor for the final orders. As regards the other appointments made in AJKMCRC, further action would be taken only after the report of the Inquiry Committee constituted by the University, duly considered by its Executive Council, becomes available.",

These bills were referred to the Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment. The Standing Committee presented its Report on 21st February 2006 to Lok Sabha. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, a notice for Official Amendments to the two bills was given to the Secretary General, Lok Sabha on 5th February 2009. However, the notice for taking up for consideration and passing of the Bills together with official amendments lapsed with the dissolution of the 14th Lok Sabha. The proposal for setting up of an `Equal Opportunity Commission` (EOC) is under consideration of the Government. (c) Sachar Committee had suggested that Muslims in India in term of their social structure consist of three groups-ashrafs, ajlafs and arzals. The three groups require different types of affirmative action. The second group, ajlafs/Other Backward Classes, need additional attention which could be similar to that of Hindu Other Backward Classes. The third group arzals, those with similar traditional occupation as that of the Scheduled Castes, may be designated as Most Backward Classes (MBCs) as they need multifarious measures, including reservation. National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities (NCRLM) had recommended that minorities should be regarded as backward in this respect within the meaning of that term as used in Article 16(4) of the Constitution Â­ notably without qualifying the word `backward` with the words `socially and educationally` - and that 15 per cent of posts in all cadres and grades under the Central and State Governments should be earmarked for them. As an alternative NCRLM recommended that in the 27 per cent Other Backward Class( OBC) quota an 8.4 per cent sub-quota should be earmarked for the minorities. NCRLM further recommended that the reservation now extended to the Scheduled Tribes, which is a religion-neutral class, should be carefully examined to assess the extent of minority presence in it and remedial measures should be initiated to correct the imbalance, if any.The Commission has also recommend that at least 15 percent seats in all non-minority educational institutions should be earmarked by law for the minorities.

The central Board of Direct taxes has issued a Circular No. 8/2009 dated 24th November, 2009 to clarify the nile position of deductibility of tax at source on payment by TPAs to hospitals etc U/S 194J of the Income Tax Act (the copy of the circular is enclosed herewith as Annexure-A). (b ),( c )&( d) The circular clearly, provides that a certificate from the Auditor of the deductee assessee stating that all the taxes and interest on the above receipts have been paid by the deductee assessee (hospitals etc) would be treated as sufficient compliance for the purpose of section 201 (1) of Income Tax Act. No time limit has been specifically given in the circular as the effect to compliance to section 201 (1) shall be considered by the AO only on the presentation of Auditor`s certificate by the deductor. The certificate U/S 203 has to be issued by the deductor, as usual, in accordance with the provisions of law. Circular No.-8 /21 F.No.385/08/2009-IT(B) Government of India Ministry of Finance Depaitment of Revenue Central Board of Direct Taxes New Delhi, dated the 24th November, 2009 Sub: Applicability of provisions under Section 194J of Income Tax Act`61 I the case of transactions by the Third Party Administrators (TPAs) wit] , Hospitals etc. A number of representations have been received from various stakeholders regarding applicability of provisions .under Section 194J of Income Tax Acf61 on payments made by Third Party Administrators (TPAs) to _ hospitals on behalf of insurance companies for settling medical/insurance claims etc with the hospitals. 2. The matter was examined by the Board. As per provisions of section 194J (1) `Any person, not being` an `individual or a Hindu undivided family` who is responsible for paying to a resident any sum by way of- (a) fees for professional services, or , , . , . (1;)` fees for technical services, [or] [(c) royalty, or (d) any sum referred to in clause (va) of section 28,J shall,at the time of credit of such sum to the account of the payee or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct an amount equal to ten per cent of such sum as income-tax on income comprised therein ... `.Further as per Explanation (a) to 194J `professional services` means` services rendered by a person in the course` of carrying on legal, medical, engineering or architectural profession etc .. `. `- 3. The services rendered by hospitals to various patients are primarily. medical services and, therefore, provisions of 194J are applicable on payments made by TP As to hospitals` etc. Further for invoking provisions of 194J, there is no stipulation that the professional services have to` be necessarily rendered to the person who makes payment to hospital. Therefore TP As who are making payment on behalf of insurance companies to hospitals for settlement of medical/insurance claims etc under various schemes including Cashless schemes are liable to deduct tax at soutce under section J 94,J on all such payments to hospitals etc. 3.1. In view of above, all such past transactions between TPAs and hospitals . fall within provisions of Section 194J and consequence of failure to deduct tax or after deducting tax failure to pay on all such transactions would make the deductor (TP As) deemed to be an assessee in defau1t in respect of such tax and also liable for charging of interest under Section 201 (IA) and penalty under- Section 271 C. 4. Considering the facts and .. circumstances of the class of cases of TPAs and insurance companies, the Board has decided that no proceedings U/S 201 may be initiated after the expiry of six years from the end of financial year in which such payment have been made without deducting tax at source etc by the TP As. The Board is also of the view that tax demand arising out of Section 201 (1) in situations arising above, may not be enforced if the deductor(TP A) satisfies the officer in charge of TDS that the relevant taxes have been paid by. the deductee assessee (hospitals etc.). A certificate from the auditor of the deductee assessee stating that the tax and interest due from deductee assessee has been paid for the assessment year concerned would be sufficient compliance for the above-purpose. However, this will not alter the liability to charge interest under Section itn (lA) of the Income TaK Act till payment of taxes by the deductee assessee or liability for penalty under Section 271C of the Income Tax Act as the case may be. 5.

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.493 FOR ANSWER ON 29.04.2010 REGARDING REVISION OF NOTIFIED LAND RATES AND GROUND RENT. (a): No, Sir. (b) & (c): The land rates for Land & Development Officeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s (L&DO) land are concessional in comparison to market rates. Land allotment through L&DO is generally done to meet the requirement of Central Government department/organizations, State Governments, Para-statal bodies, religious, social and educational institutions and recognized political parties on temporary or leasehold basis. The present formula for determination of ground rent by L&DO for leased land for Delhi is based on a decision communicated by the Government on 6th December, 1983 and circulated on 18th January, 1984 wherein various issues including the determination of letting value of land on the basis of market value were considered. The existing notified rates of land used for allotment and determination of ground rent of leased properties by Delhi Development Authority are determined under Nazul Rules with the approval of Central Government and are notified as pre-determined rates (PDR). The basis for determination of PDR includes cost of development, cost of acquisition, cost of money, etc. The market land rates reflect the commercial value of land and are always higher and cannot be compared with the rates notified by the Government for allotment of land on temporary or leasehold basis. Upward revision of concessional rate/PDR and ground rent cannot be commensurate with the real estate price.",

Noise level mapping is a different exercise and ambient noise monitoring is a basic step before noise mapping. A roadmap has been developed by the CPCB for ambient noise monitoring in seven cities, namely, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chemiai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Lucknow for establishment of ten monitoring stations in each city. (c)&(d): CPCB and the SPCBs/PCCs have been carrying out sporadic noise monitoring in urban areas, including above seven cities, mainly during festivals such as Deepawali.

Advertisements i) Commercial advertisements are information as much as social, economic or political information. What is more, advertisements shape attitude and ways of life at least as much, as other kinds of information and comment. Journalistic propriety demands that advertisements must be clearly distinguishable from news content carried in the newspaper. ii) No advertisement shall be published, which promotes directly or indirectly production, sale or consumption of cigarettes, tobacco products, wine, alcohol, liquor and other intoxicants. iii) Newspaper shall not publish advertisements, which have a tendency to malign or hurt the religious sentiments of any community or section of society. iv) Advertisements which offend the provisions of the Drugs and Magical Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act as amended in 2002, or any other statute should be rejected. v) Newspapers should not publish an advertisement containing anything which is unlawful or illegal, or is contrary to public decency, good taste or to journalistic ethics or propriety. vi) Journalistic propriety demands that advertisements must be clearly distinguishable from editorial matter carried in the newspaper. Newspapers while publishing advertisements should specify the amount received by them. The rationale behind this is that advertisements should be charged at rates usually chargeable by a newspaper since payment of more than the normal rates would amount to a subsidy to the paper. vii) Publication of dummy or lifted advertisements that have neither been paid for, nor authorised by the advertisers, constitute breach of journalistic ethics specially when the paper raises a bill in respect of such advertisements. viii) Deliberate failure to publish an advertisement in all the copies of a newspaper offends against the standards of journalistic ethics and constitutes gross professional misconduct. ix) There should be total co-ordination and communication between the advertisement department and the editorial department of a newspaper in the matter of considering the legality propriety or otherwise of an advertisement received for publication. x) The editors should insist on their right to have the final say in the acceptance or rejection of advertisements, specially those which border on or cross the line between decency and obscenity. xi) Newspapers to carry caution notice with matrimonial advertisements carrying following text â<U+0080><U+009C>Readers are advised to make appropriate thorough inquiries before acting upon any advertisement. This newspaper does not vouch or subscribe to claim and representation made by the advertiser regarding the particulars of status, age, income of the bride/bridegroomâ<U+0080>. The Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble High Court of Delhi in connection with FAO No 65/1998 of Smt Harjeet Kaur Vs Shri Surinder Pal Singh directed the Press Council of India to instruct the newspaper to publish classified/matrimonial advertisement by advising them to alongside publish the said Caution Notice in their newspapers. xii) An editor shall be responsible for all matters, including advertisements published in the newspaper. If responsibility is disclaimed, this shall be explicitly stated beforehand. xiii) Tele-friendship advertisements carried by newspapers across the country inviting general public to dial the given number for â<U+0080><U+0098>entertainingâ<U+0080><U+0099> talk and offering suggestive tele-talk tend to pollute adolescent minds and promote immoral cultural ethos. The Press should refuse to accept such advertisements. xiv) Classified advertisements of health and physical fitness services using undignified languages, indicative of covert soliciting, are violative of law as well as ethics. The newspaper should adopt a mechanism for vetting such an advertisement to ensure that the soliciting advertisements are not carried. xv) Advertisements of contraceptive and supply of brand item attaching to the advertisement is not very ethical, given the social milieu and the traditional values held dear in our country. A newspaper has a sacred duty to educate people about precautionary measures to avoid AIDS and exhibit greater far sight in accepting advertisement even though issued by social welfare organisation. (xvi) Employment News which is trusted as a purveyor of authentic news on government jobs should be more careful in accepting advertisements of only bonafide private bodies. (xvii) While accepting advertisements of educational institutes newspapers may ensure that such advertisements carry the mandatory statement that the concerned institutes are recognized under the relevant enactments of law. xviii) Advertisements play extremely vital role in shaping the values and concerns of the present day society and as more and more lenient view is taken of what is not the norm, the speedier may be acceptability of such matters in â<U+0080><U+0098>public perceptionâ<U+0080><U+0099> but at what cost is the essential point for consideration. It should be borne in mind that in the race to be globally relevant we do not leave behind the values that have earned India the unique place it enjoys globally on moral and ethical plane.",

The Sachar Committee had brought out clearly the educational deprivation experienced by the Muslim community and that the problem is more acute for girls/women. It had observed that low aggregate work participation ratios for Muslims are essentially due to much lower participation in economic activity by women in the community. The report mentions that â<U+0080><U+009C>one of the reasons for lower participation rates of Muslim women may be higher dependency rates due to relatively higher share of younger population in the community, resulting in women staying at home â<U+0080><U+009C>.

(b) The mean years of schooling (MYS) is lower compared to the average MYS for all children. (c) 25% of Muslim children in the 6 â<U+0080><U+0093> 14 year age group have either never attended school or have dropped out. (d) The majority of Muslim girls and boys fail in their matriculation examination or drop out before that. (e) Less than 4% of Muslims are graduates or diploma holders compared to about 7% of the population aged 20 years and above. (f) There is a strong desire and enthusiasm for education among Muslim women and girls across the board. (g) Schools beyond primary level are few in Muslim localities. Exclusive schools for girls are fewer. (h) Lack of hostel facilities is a limiting factor, especially for girls. (i) Muslim parents are not averse to modern or mainstream education and to sending their children to affordable Government schools. They do not necessarily prefer to send children to madarsas. However, the access to government schools for Muslim children is limited. (II) Skill development (a) Skill development initiatives for those who have not completed school education may be particularly relevant for some sections of Muslims given their occupational structure. (b) The skill demands in the manufacturing and service sectors are changing continuously and youth with middle school education would meet these needs. (c) A rehabilitation package for innovative re-skilling and for upgrading the occupational structure in the wake of liberalization is seen as an urgent need. (III) Employment and economic opportunities: (a) Self-employment is the main source of income of Muslims. They are engaged more in self-employed manufacturing and trade activities compared to others. (b) The share of Muslim workers engaged in street vending is the highest. More than 12 per cent of Muslim male workers are engaged in street vending as compared to the national average of less than 8 per cent. (c) The percentage of women Muslim workers undertaking work within their own homes is much larger at 70 per cent compared to all workers at 51 per cent. (d) The share of Muslims in the total workers engaged in the tobacco and textiles/garment related industries are quite significant.

(g) While the participation of Muslim workers is relatively higher in production and sales related occupations, their participation was relatively lower in professional, technical, clerical and to some extent managerial work. (h) Muslims, by and large, are engaged in the unorganized sector of the economy and have to bear the brunt of liberalization. (i) The participation of Muslims in regular salaried jobs is much less than workers of other socio-religious categories. (j) Muslims are relatively more vulnerable in terms of conditions of work as their concentration in informal sector employment is higher and their job conditions, even among regular workers, are less for Muslims than those of other socio-religious communities. (k) Percentage of households availing banking facilities is much lower in villages where the share of Muslim population is high. (IV) Poverty and development (a) About 38 % of Muslims in urban areas and 27 % in rural areas live below the poverty level. (b) Muslims are concentrated in locations with poor infrastructure facilities. This affects their access to basic services like education, health facilities, transport, etc. (c) About a third of small villages with high concentration of Muslims do not have any educational institutions. (d) There is a scarcity of medical facilities in larger villages with a substantial Muslim concentration. About 40% of large villages with a substantial Muslim concentration do not have any medical facilities. (e) Muslim concentration villages are not well served with pucca roads. (f) Policies to deal with the relative deprivation of the Muslims in the country should sharply focus on inclusive development and mainstreaming of the community while respecting diversity. (v) Social conditions (a) A community-specific factor for low educational achievement is that Muslims do not see education as necessarily translating into formal employment (b) The Muslim population shows an increasingly better sex ratio compared with other socio-religious communities. (c) Infant and childhood mortality among Muslims is slightly lower than the average. (d) There has been a large decline in fertility in all the religious groups including Muslims.",

M. VEERAPPA MOILY) (a) to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in reply to parts (a), (b) and (c) of the Rajya Sabha Starred Question No.82 for answer on 15.11.2010. (a) & (b): The Hon`ble High Court of Delhi paragraphs 14 and 15 of its judgment and order dated 11 August, 2010 in Writ Petition (Criminal) 1003 of 2010 in the case of Jitender Kumar Sharma Vs. State and Another has inter alia observed as under:- `14. It is clear that because of the change in law brought .about by the enactment of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and repeal of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, the statement of law with regard to the validity of a child marriage has to be modified. The legal principle that a marriage in` contravention of Clause (iii) of Section 5 of the HMA was `neither void nor voidable`, was established prior to the enactment of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The principle which is now applicable is that a marriage in contravention of Clause (iii) of Section 5 of the HMA is not ipso facto void but could be void if any of the circumstances enumerated in Section 12 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 is triggered and that, in any event, all such marriages would be voidable at the option of the `child` spouse in terms of Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. 15. We also find that stronger punishments for offences under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 have been prescribed and that the offences have also been made cognizable and non-bailable but, this does not in any event have any impact on the validity of`child marriage. This is apparent from the fact that while the legislature brought these changes on the punitive aspects of child marriages it, at the same time brought about conscious changes to the aspect having a bearing on the validity of child marriages. It made a specific provision for void marriages under certain circumstances but did not render all child marriages void. It also introduced the concept of a voidable child marriage. The flip-side of which clearly indicated that all child marriages were not void. For, one cannot make something voidable which is already void or invalid.`. (c): The extant position of law is that the marriage between two minors is not void but voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage. The provisions of sections 5 (iii), 11, 13 (2) (iv) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and sections 3 and 4 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 point towards this position of law. However, parties to such marriages are punishable in law as may be seen from the provisions of section 18 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Hence, no action is considered necessary.",

The Government of Pakistan stated that it was fully cognizant of the situation and looked after the welfare of all its citizens, particularly the minority community. The Government of Bangladesh has also assured us that it is committed to safeguarding minority rights.

In respect of migrants from East Bengal, West Bengal, Assam and Tripura, the two Governments agreed to ensure, inter alia, freedom of movement, protection in transit, freedom to remove movable personal effects, protect the right of ownership provided the migrants came back by 31.12.1950.

After the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971, those Commissions no longer exist. The Simla Agreement of 1972 between India and Pakistan specifically provides for non-interference in each otherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s internal affairs.

Though there is no accurate statistics on the precise number of Hindus, it would be reasonable to state that a large number of the Indian nationals and PIOs are Hindus. (b) No reports have been received that Indian citizens, who are mostly Hindus, are being inhumanely treated in Malaysia. (c) There are numerous Hindu places of worship through Malaysia and there is no restriction on Indian nationals to visit or offer prayers in these places of worship. The overwhelming number of Hindus residing in Malaysia is citizens of Malaysia and is well integrated into their system. Their rights as citizens of Malaysia, including the right to follow their religion, are derived from the Malaysian Constitution. (d) The Government of India remains deeply solicitous of the welfare of the PIOs living abroad. We have friendly relations with Malaysia and we remain in touch with the Malaysian authorities whenever there is some concern on the interest of PIOs living in Malaysia. [During Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singhâ<U+0080><U+0099>s visit to Malaysia in October 2010, the Prime Minister of Malaysia in an answer to a question relating to a â<U+0080><U+009C>sense of being left out and discrimination within Malaysian Indian communityâ<U+0080> stated that â<U+0080><U+009C>Like India, Malaysia is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic community. It is democracy and respects the fundamental human rights of all its citizens and I am confident that Malaysian system has built-in flexibility to tackle any problems of the type you have mentioned. I have, therefore, no reason to be apprehensive on that account about the future of Indian origin community in this great countryâ<U+0080>.",

In Tamil Nadu, this system of cultivation gives paddy yields between 6 t and 13 t per hectare as against an average yield of 4 t per hectare using conventional practices. However, this depends on several other factors such as variety of seed material, climate, soil type and source of irrigation. (b) & (c): Yes, Sir. This method of paddy cultivation was earlier known as System of Rice Intensification (SRI). On 26.09.2010, Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu named this system as â<U+0080><U+009C>Rajarajan 1000â<U+0080> to commemorate 1000 years celebration of Tanjore Temple constructed by Chola King Rajarajan. Components of this technology are:- Adoption of 7.5 Kg seed rate per ha. Nursery area, 100 mÂ² for 1 ha. Seedling age, 14 to 16 days. Transplanting single seedling at 25 cm x 25 cm spacing. Four times mechanical weeding at 10, 20, 30 & 40 days after transplanting. Alternate wetting and drying up to panicle initiation stage. It is recommended to irrigate the field to 2.5 cm after the previously irrigated water disappears and hairline cracks develop. Nutrient application based on soil testing. (d) Farmers are getting increased yields under this system as compared to the conventional system. Nearly 30 percent of total System of Rice Intensification farmers are getting on an average yield of 8 tonnes per ha. Against 4 tonnes under normal system. There is no evidence about early maturity of paddy in this System of Rice Intensification. (e) Government is providing subsidy to the farmers for organizing System of Rice Intensification demonstrations. The system is gaining popularity in several states of the country particularly Andhra Pradesh and Tripura.",

The various stages of appraisal/ evaluation adopted are explained below: Pre-funding Appraisal All the proposals received are desk appraised by the program divisions concerned in a systematic manner so as to ensure that right type of organizations and projects are entertained for funding. When the concerned Division finds everything in order at the desk stage, the proposal is processed for pre-funding appraisal of the project through an empanelled Institutional Monitor. Proposals not meeting the requisite requirements are either rejected or additional information obtained depending upon the quantum of information lacking. The Institutional Monitor appointed should discharge the work within 45 days from the date of receipt of the assignment order. Based on the findings, the proposals are further processed for working out the scale of assistance to be extended, moderated. Thereafter, proposals are placed before either the Regional Committee (RC) or National Standing Committee (NSC) or Executive Committee (EC) depending of the quantum of assistance to be approved. On the approval of the competent Committee, sanction letter along with terms & Condition governing the financial assistance is issued to the VOs. On sanction, funds are released in various stages depending upon the requirements in more than one installments by obtaining progress and field evaluation reports. Mid - Term Evaluation Grant recipient organizations are expected to forward the progress report in the prescribed format either on a Monthly/ Quarterly / Half - yearly basis depending upon the nature of the project. Mid term evaluations are carried out through an empanelled Institutional Monitor/ subject matter specialist relevant to the project in a participatory manner. The report is expected to furnish information on matters like transparency in the execution, beneficiary consultation & their involvement in implementation of the project, quality of work, procedure adopted in procurement of materials, maintenance of books of accounts etc. Based on the evaluation findings either further funds are released or additional information obtained. Post Evaluation On receipt of the completion report and other final document, post evaluation are carried out by the empanelled Institutional Monitors to obtain information on the following:- To verify whether all the stipulated work has been carried out as per the terms of the sanction order. To ascertain beneficiaries` satisfaction in the implementation/ creation of assets. To verify the books of accounts and other related documents to ensure proper utilization of funds. To assess the impact of the project and arrangements made for sustainability. Impact & Comprehensive Evaluation In addition to the routine evaluations as stated above, CAPART also undertakes comprehensive evaluation study of the NGOs if the quantum of assistance given for a single project exceeds to Rs.50.00 Lakhs or several projects exceed to Rs.100.00 lakhs during a period of 4 years. Provision for funding restrictions In case, CAPART observes that the funds released to the NGOs are not properly utilized, the concerned NGOs are kept under funding restrictions either as Further Assistance Stopped (FAS) or Blacklisting till the proper corrections are made. Restrictions are imposed on the following major grounds: For accomplishing the work through contractors. Violations of terms and conditions. Adverse evaluation findings. Mis-utilisation or diversion of funds for other than the intended purpose. Non - submission of requisite documents Change of location, beneficiaries without prior approval of CAPART. Falsification of documents Legal Action for recovery of misused grants In case of breach of terms & Condition governing the assistance extended to the NGOs and non receipt of mis-utilized grants, CAPART initiates legal action for recovery against the default NGOs as per the court of law.",

(c) if so, whether even after this vigil, wrongful facts about the renowned leaders of ","MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI KAPIL SIBAL) (a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.437 FOR 02.09.2011 REGARDING MISUSE OF SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (a): Social networking sites have emerged as an online medium / platform to enable users to share ideas, activities & events and express views/opinions on specific topics / events. Several groups and individuals have hosted content on these social networking sites for a variety of purposes, which may be liked by one section of society and used gainfully. Such sites can be accessed by all sections of users. Most of such networking sites are hosted outside the country. During the period April 2010 to July 2011, a total no. of 33 incidents of misuse of social networking sites, related to publishing of objectionable content pertaining to political leaders, religion, national security and individuals were reported to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). (b), (c) and (d): Millions of users worldwide from all sections of society use social networking sites. The technology and the associated application of social networking allows the users to post the content of their choice automatically after registration with such sites without the role of service providers hosting such sites. The large number of users logging on to the sites and millions of pages on such sites make it practically very difficult to keep a vigil on all contents posted/hosted on these sites. Further, Government does not regulate content of the social networking sites. Government has notified Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011 under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. These rules provide for the intermediaries to follow self-regulation. The intermediaries are also required to designate a grievance officer to redress such requests by the affected person. Any affected person may report the misuse of networking sites to the intermediary hosting these networking sites and request for removal / disabling of wrongful facts or objectionable content. Also, the Telecom Service Providers provide, as per the terms and conditions of their license agreements, facilities for lawful interception and monitoring of communication flowing through their network including communications from social networking sites. However, the solution service providers of social networking sites secure certain communication to and from such networking sites by employing encryption, which pose challenges to security agencies to keep a vigil on contents of such sites. The Government regularly interacts with Telecom Service providers and Solution Service Providers to address the issue and implement solutions to the extent possible keeping in view security, service and developmental needs of the country.",

Thus, there appears to be no Hindu - Muslim divide on women suffering from malnutrition.The problem of malnutrition is complex, multi-dimensional and inter-generational in nature. The approach to dealing with the nutrition challenges has been two pronged: Multi-sectoral approach for accelerated action on the determinants of malnutrition in targeting nutrition in schemes/ programmes of all the sectors. As the multi-sectoral approach takes some time to show results and when implemented together, have a trickle down and horizontal effect to benefit the population over a period of time, other part of the approach is direct and specific interventions targeted towards the vulnerable groups such as children below 6 years, adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating mothers. The Government has accorded priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several schemes /programmes of different Ministries/Departments through State Governments/UT Administrations which directly or indirectly have an impact on the nutritional status of the children. Several of the schemes namely, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, National Rural Health Mission (NRHM ), Mid Day Meal Scheme (MDM, Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) have been expanded in recent years to provide for increased coverage and improved services to the people and the impact of these schemes are likely to be visible after some time.

Ashwani Kumar (AIR 2006 SC 1158) has inter alia directed the State Governments that marriages of all persons who are citizens of India belonging to various religious denominations should be made compulsorily registerable in their respective States where such marriages are solemnized. The States of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Orissa, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Tripura have already taken necessary legislative measures providing for compulsory registration of marriages. Other States except the State of Nagaland are in the process of achieving this end. The Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Supreme Court of India further inter alia directed the Central Government as and when the Central Government enacts a comprehensive statute, the same shall be placed before the Supreme Court for scrutiny.

Out of these seven cases five cases are under trial in various Courts, while in two cases closure reports have been accepted by the Courts.It has been mentioned in the memorandum that the charge sheet in a murder case against Sh.

The facts of the case are that the IO of the case FIR No. 67/87 claimed that the charge sheet of this case was clubbed with the charge sheet of case FIR No. 418/91. However, the Court found this claim to be incorrect vide its judgement dated 23.10.2010. When this came to light, the Government decided to transfer this case to the CBI for investigation. The Commissioner of Police, Delhi has been asked to take action against the officers responsible. As regards the case FIR No. 416/84 u/s 147/148/149/302/427/436 IPC P.S.

The legal opinion was obtained by the Delhi Police and the complainant was contacted several times, but she did not join the investigation. A closure report was filed by Delhi Police before the Court on 22.12.2005. The complainant was directed by the Court to appear before it, but she failed to do. The Court then consigned the file to record. In the meantime CBI registered a fresh case vide RC No. 24 (S)/2005/CBI/SCR/I/New Delhi on 22/11/2005 on the recommendations of Nanavati Commission and the orders of MHA and filed a charge sheet against Sajjan Kumar and others.The accused Sajjan Kumar filed a Crl.

(a) While information regarding recognition by states of the minority status of universities and colleges is not maintained centrally, among the Central Universities, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Act, 1920, defines the University as â<U+0080><U+009C>the educational institution of their choice established by the Muslims of India, which originated as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh and which was subsequently incorporated as the Aligarh Muslim Universityâ<U+0080>. The matter regarding minority status of AMU is presently sub-judice before the Supreme Court of India. The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions(NCMEI) is also empowered under section 11(f) of NCMEI Act, 2004, (2 of 2005), to decide all questions relating to minority status of an educational institution and declare its status as such. As on 31.10.2011, the Commission has granted minority status certificates to 5041 educational institutions. Such certificates were granted by the Commission to 21 institutions in the year 2005, 422 institutions in 2006, 737 institutions in 2007, 507 institutions in 2008, 848 institutions in 2009, 1122 institutions in 2010, and 1384 institutions in 2011 upto 31.10.2011. The Commission under the power vested in it by the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004, (2 of 2005), has granted minority status to Jamia Millia Islamia University , Delhi and Yenepoya University (a deemed to be University), Mangalore. The matter regarding minority status of Jamia Millia Islamia is also presently sub-judice.(b) The question as to whether an educational institution enjoys minority status under Article 30 (1) of the Constitution is determined by the provisions of the Act/Statutes/Memorandum of Association establishing that institution. The minority status to an educational institution is conferred by the central/state government, under whose jurisdiction the institution falls. As per Section 11(f) and 12B of NCMEI Act, 2004 (2 of 2005), the Commission can decide questions relating to the minority status of an institution and entertain and issue orders on the appeals filed before it relating to minority status of an institution.(c) to (e) Article 30(1) of the Constitution guarantees the right of religious or linguistic minorities, to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Article 15(5) of the Constitution exempts the minority educational institutions covered under Article 30(1), from the provision of reservation in admission to educational institutions for any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. Section 4(c) of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, in consonance with the provisions of the Constitution, exempts the minority educational institutions from the purview of the said Act.",

This is expected to involve employment of around 28 Million people at various levels.Annexure IBrief on the Draft National Policy on Electronics, 2011 (NPE 2011)India is one of the fastest growing markets of electronics in the world. However, it lags behind in electronics hardware manufacturing capabilities, even though it is increasingly becoming a destination for chip design and embedded software. The Indian demand for electronics was USD 45 billion in 2008-09 and is expected to reach USD 400 billion by 2020. The domestic production is expected to grow from USD 20 billion to USD 100 billion leaving a gap of USD 300 billion. Moreover, the actual value-addition in the domestically produced electronic products is very low, ranging between 5 to 10 percent in most cases. Apart from the economic opportunity it presents, electronics is of strategic importance as well. On the other hand, the domestic manufacturing in the sector is handicapped by the Information Technology Agreement-1 of the World Trade Organization, which binds most of the electronic items to zero tariffs. The policy envisions creation of a globally competitive electronics design and manufacturing (ESDM) industry to meet the country''s needs and serve the international market. The salient features of the policy include:1. Multi-fold growth in production, investment and employment: Achieving a turnover of about USD 400 billion by 2020 involving investment of about USD 100 billion and employment to around 28 million people at various levels. Interalia, the following specific initiatives are proposed:a. Setting up of semiconductor wafer fabs for manufacture of semiconductor chips.b. A Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme providing for the disabilities in manufacturing in the sector.c. Electronic Manufacturing Clusters Scheme for about 200 clusters with world-class infrastructure.d. Preferential Market Access for domestically manufactured electronic goods to address strategic and security concerns and consistent with international commitments. e. Provide for 10 year stable tax regime1. Semiconductor chip design industry: Building on the emerging chip design and embedded software industry to achieve global leadership and to achieve USD 55 billion by 2020.2. Multi-fold growth in Export: To increase the export from USD 5.5 billion to USD 80 billion by 2020.3.

During the current fiscal 2011-12 (April â<U+0080><U+0093> February 2012), import of gold and silver together amounted to US$ 54.5 billion, which is 12.6 per cent of total imports (Source DGCI&S, Ministry of Commerce).

Such imports do not however have a direct bearing on foreign exchange reserves, as the Reserve Bank of India intervenes in the foreign exchange market through purchase / sale operations only to curb excessive volatility and restore orderliness in the market. To lower the impact of gold imports on BoP, Government in the Union Budget 2012-13 has proposed to increase basic custom duty on standard gold bars, gold coins of purity exceeding 99.5 per cent and platinum from 2 per cent to 4 per cent and on non-standard gold from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. *****",

Of the approximately 4000 researchers world-wide involved in this programme, about 80 are from India. Since 1994 India has been participating in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments in all aspects: These include the fabrication of LHC machine components (special types of magnets), fabrication of some of the sub-detectors for big experiments at LHC [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE)] as well as development of grid computing technology and hosting two grid computing centres in India for the experiments. Indian scientists are regularly participating and discharging various functions as a part of experimental programme like data collection, data quality monitoring, monitoring computing efforts for data process and transfer and detector performances. They are playing key roles in the analyses of data, scrutiny of results and presentation of results in international fora of scientists. Since the start of the LHC machine in November 2009, the data collected during first two years have been primarily used to establish the credibility of the LHC experiments as a precursor to the discovery of Higgâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Boson. The recent discovery is the outcome following the huge data collected by CMS experiment during 2011 and 2012.

Krishna to Pakistan. Pakistanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Interior Minister Mr. Rehman Malik signed the agreement on behalf of the Government of Pakistan. Several new features have been introduced in the travel regime through this Agreement.2. A single entry â<U+0080><U+0098>Visitor Visaâ<U+0080><U+0099> will be issued to a person visiting the other country (to meet relatives, friends, or for any other legitimate purposes) for a maximum of five specified places (as opposed to three places under the extant rules) and for a period not exceeding six months. The visa shall also specify that the duration of stay at a time shall not exceed three months. A â<U+0080><U+0098>Visitor Visaâ<U+0080><U+0099> for a maximum of five specific places may also be issued for a longer period of upto two years with multiple entries to: (a) senior citizens (those above 65 years of age); (b) national of one country, married to a national of the other country; and (c) children below 12 years of age accompanying parents as given in (b).3. To address the concerns of the business community in both countries a separate category of â<U+0080><U+0098>Business Visaâ<U+0080><U+0099> has been introduced under the new Agreement. Such a visa will be issued to bona-fide businessman who intend to travel for business purposes between India and Pakistan and who fall in two categories:(i) Businessman with income of Pak Rs. half million or equivalent per annum, or annual turnover/gross sale of Pak Rs. three million or equivalent will be given a one year Business Visa with five places, for upto four entries. (ii) Businessman with an income of at least Pak Rs. five million or equivalent per annum or turnover of Pak Rs. 30 million or equivalent per annum will be given one year multiple entry visas, for upto 10 places, with exemption from police reporting. The maximum time that will be taken in processing Business Visas will not exceed more than five weeks. 4. New categories of Pilgrim Visas, and Visa on Arrival have also been introduced. The Group Tourist Visa category has been further liberalized. 5. The â<U+0080><U+0098>Pilgrim Visaâ<U+0080><U+0099> will be issued to persons intending to visit religious shrines in India and Pakistan, as per the 1974 Protocol on Visit to Religious Shrines or any future revision made to this Protocol.6. The Group Tourist Visa will now be valid for a period upto 30 days (compared to the earlier 14 days) and may be issued to individual applicants for travel in groups, with not less than 10 members and not more than 50 members in each group, organized by approved tour operators/travel agents. The tour operator will be made responsible for police reporting on behalf of the groups, both on the arrival and departure of the group. The Group Tourist Visa facility will also be available to students of educational institutions of both countries. However, this will be a tourist visa and not for seeking admission in educational institutions. Such tours should be organized by known and reputed academic institutions with sponsorship from a similar institution, purely for non-religious purposes and prior clearance for the tour should have been taken by the approved tour operator from the host country. 7. A â<U+0080><U+0098>Visa on Arrivalâ<U+0080><U+0099> facility is being provided for persons of more than 65 years of age who will be granted single entry visas on arrival at the Attari/Wagah Check Post for 45 days on a non-convertible, non-extendable basis. 8. In addition other measures to ease the implementation of the regime have also been introduced. Normally, the same check-post and same mode of journey for entry and exit would be permitted. In cases where the applicant, at the time of application, has indicated clearly an Exit point different from the Entry point or a mode of Exit journey different from the mode of Entry journey, it can be allowed. However, this is subject to the exception that Exit from Wagha/Attari, by road (on foot) cannot be accepted, unless the entry was also on foot via Attari/Wagha. Furthermore in the matter related to the mandatory police reporting/registration, persons of more than 65 years of age and children below 12 years of age, and prominent businesspersons eligible for one year multiple entry visas for upto 10 places, will be exempted from Police Reporting. 9. Thus, the new Visa Agreement significantly liberalizes the bilateral visa regime in operation between the two countries. It introduces several measures aimed at easing travel between the countries of business persons, tourists, pilgrims, the elderly and children. This will facilitate greater contacts between peoples of the two countries who remain at the heart of the India-Pakistan relationship. *****",

CSIR has adopted villages to promote employment generation. It has thus catalyzed commercial cultivation of Geranium in Uttaranchal and Lavender in Jammu & Kashmir through community participation. In this end to end mission farmers have been trained not only for cultivation of Geranium and Lavender but also for extraction of oil. Likewise CSIR efforts through development of niche Mentha varieties and their propagation for mass cultivation are noteworthy. The efforts have led India acquire a world leadership position in Menthol mint oil production and export.CSIR has set up post harvest centres in Mizoram (Aizawl) and Arunachal Pradesh (Pashighat). These centres are focused at helping the local farmers in the region for value addition to their agricultural produce. The centres house technology for high efficiency drying and processing of ginger, cardamom, turmeric, chillies etc. The farmers are able to sell their produce at 20 â<U+0080><U+0093> 25% higher price to these processing centres. The CSIR Post Harvest Technology Centres are thus generating direct employment. CSIR efforts have lead to: empowering people at Kashmir Valley through creation of aromatic industry; development of bioinoculants for enhancing plant productivity, disseminated in UP to the farmers in partnership with the State Government on a very large scale and has enhanced agriculture productivity; mushroom technology transfer and training which has benefited rural women in North East states; the ethnic products promotion for economic development which has benefited the women entrepreneurs of Manipur.

Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) that are predominantly engaged in lending against collateral of gold jewellery have recorded significant growth in recent years, both in terms of their balance sheet size and physical presence. Certain prudential measures were taken on account of regulatory concerns, given the rapid pace of their business growth and the nature of their business model which has inherent concentration risk. The measures include a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio not exceeding 60 per cent for loans against collateral of gold jewellery and a minimum Tier 1 capital of 12 per cent by April 1, 2014. It has been stipulated that NBFCs should not grant any advance against bullion/primary gold and gold coins. Banks were advised to reduce their regulatory exposure ceiling in a single NBFC, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of its total financial assets, from the existing 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent of bankâ<U+0080><U+0099>s capital funds. However, exposure ceiling may go up by 5 per cent, i.e., up to 12.5 per cent of bankâ<U+0080><U+0099>s capital funds if the additional exposure is on account of funds on-lent by NBFCs to the infrastructure sector; and (ii) banks should have an internal sub-limit on their aggregate exposure to all such NBFCs, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of their total financial assets, taken together.(b) According to DGCI&S data, gold imports in US$ terms grew significantly in the preceding four years (2008-09 to 2011-12).

In furtherance of its objectives, PCI have formed Norms of Journalistic Conduct under section 13(2)(b) of the Press Council Act, 1978 which cover the principles and ethics of journalism. The Norm 41 (A) relating to the subject â<U+0080><U+0098>Trial by Mediaâ<U+0080><U+0099> prescribes that measures which are necessary for due process of law need to take precedence over freedom of speech. In a conflict between fair trial and freedom of speech, fair trial has to necessarily prevail because any compromise of fair trial for an accused will cause immense harm and defeat the justice delivery system. The guidelines are based on the premise that an accused is entitled to the privilege of presumption of being innocent till guilt is pronounced by the Court. Norm 20 on the subject â<U+0080><U+0098>Covering communal disputes/clashes prescribes that news, views or comments relating to communal or religious disputes/clashes shall be published after proper verification of facts and presented with due caution and restraint in a manner which is conducive to the creation of an atmosphere congenial to communal harmony, amity and peace. Sensational, provocative and alarming headlines are to be avoided. The Norm 22 in regard to the caste, religion or community references in the publications prescribes that the caste identification of a person or a particular class should be avoided, particularly when in the context it conveys a sense or attributes a conduct or practice derogatory to that caste. A copy each of the referred norms is annexed. The complaints of contents in print media, which are in violation of these norms, are adjudicated by PCI under section 14 of the Press Council Act, 1978. In so far as electronic media is concerned, although there is no pre-censorship of the content telecast on private satellite TV channels, all such TV channels are required to adhere to the Programme Code prescribed under Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and Cable Television Network Rules, 1994 framed thereunder. The said codes provide for a whole range of parameters to regulate programmes and advertisements on TV channels. Rule 6(d) provides that no programme should be carried in the cable service which contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths. Also, Rule 6(i) provides that no programme should be carried in the cable service which criticises, maligns or slanders any individual in person or certain groups, segments of social, public and moral life of the country. Regarding programmes covering sensitive issues, Rule 6(e) provides that no programme should be carried in the cable service which is likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promote anti-national attitudes. Rule 6(h) provides that no programme should be carried in the cable service which contains anything affecting the integrity of the Nation.*****",

SHASHI THAROOR) (a) & (b) No Sir. The plans and programmes regarding education to minorities have received the required fillip during the last few years. The Ministry of Human Resource Development is implementing the Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madarasas (SPQEM) and the Scheme for Infrastructure Development in Minority Institutes (IDMI) exclusively for the benefit of the minorities. Besides, under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the enrolment share of the Muslim children in the age group of 6-14 years has increased from 11.03% in the year 2008-09 to 13.31% in the year 2011-12 at the primary level. The scheme of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), inter alia provides coverage of special focus groups viz. girlsâ<U+0080><U+0099>, children belonging to SC, ST, OBC, and Educationally Backward Minorities. While implementing other Schemes too, inter-alia, such as the Saakshar Bharat, the Jan Shikshan Sansthan, the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, the Womenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Hostels, the Block Institutes of Teacher Education, special focus is given to the Minority Concentration Districts. As per the data made available by the District Information System for Education (DISE), the number of the Muslim children enrolled in schools in elementary education has increased from 1.58 crore in 2005-06 to 2.55 crore in 2011-12. The enrolment of Muslim children as a percentage of total enrolment has also increased from 8.84% to 12.97%. The enrolment of the Muslim children has also grown at higher pace at the Upper Primary stage compared to the primary stage between 2006-07 and 2011-12. (c) to (e) No Sir. The number of the Minority Educational Institutions running with the help of the Government has increased during the last few years. Under the Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madarsas (SPQEM), the number of Madarsas which are provided financial assistance has increased from 1979 in the year 2009-10 to 9905 in the year 2012-13. Similarly under the Scheme for Infrastructure Development for Minority Institutes (IDMI), the number of the Minority Institutions supported, has increased from 22 in the year 2009-10 to 174 during 2012-13. In the Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs), during the year 2009-10 to 2011-12, approval has been accorded for upgradation of 890 existing schools to the secondary school level, out of which 634 schools have since become functional. After extension of the Mid-Day-Meal Scheme to Madarsas and Maktabs in 2008, the enrolment of the Muslim children has increased at a primary stage and upper primary stage. Under the Scheme for setting up of Model Degree Colleges, establishment of colleges in 62 MCDs has been approved. Similarly, Under the Sub-Mission on Polytechnics where the Government of India provides financial assistance to the State Governments, the establishment of polytechnics in 54 MCDs has been approved.

ASHWANI KUMAR)(a) to (f) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (f) of the unstarred Question no. 4252 for answer in the Rajya Sabha on 06.05.2013.(a) The information is being collected and will be laid on the Table of the House.(b)to (f) A Public Interest Litigation may be filed before the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution or before the High Court of a State under Article 226 of the Constitution under their respective Writ Jurisdictions. The Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Supreme Court from time to time through its various judgments has observed that the Court must be careful to see that the member of the public, who approaches the court through Public Interest Litigation is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private profit or political motivation or other oblique consideration. The court must not allow its process to be abused by any people, organisations and institutions by filing meaningless petitions in the name of PILs. Public-interest litigation is a rule of declared law by the courts of record. However, the person (or entity) filing the petition must prove to the satisfaction of the court that the petition is being filed for the public interest and not as a frivolous litigation for pecuniary gain. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttaranchal vs. Balwant Singh Chaufal and others has held that in order to preserve the purity and sanctity of the PIL, it has become imperative to issue the following directions:-(a) The courts must encourage genuine and bona fide PIL and effectively discourage and curb the PIL filed for extraneous considerations.(b) Instead of every individual judge devising his own procedure for dealing with the public interest litigation, it would be appropriate for each High Court to properly formulate rules for encouraging the genuine PIL and discouraging the PIL filed with oblique motives. Consequently, we request that the High Courts who have not yet framed the rules, should frame the rules within three months. The Registrar General of each High Court is directed to ensure that a copy of the Rules prepared by the High Court is sent to the Secretary General of this court immediately thereafter.(c) The courts should prima facie verify the credentials of the petitioner before entertaining a P.I.L.(d) The court should be prima facie satisfied regarding the correctness of the contents of the petition before entertaining a PIL.(e) The court should be fully satisfied that substantial public interest is involved before entertaining the petition.(f) The court should ensure that the petition which involves larger public interest, gravity and urgency must be given priority over other petitions.(g) The courts before entertaining the PIL should ensure that the PIL is aimed at redressal of genuine public harm or public injury. The court should also ensure that there is no personal gain, private motive or oblique motive behind filing the public interest litigation.(h) The court should also ensure that the petitions filed by busybodies for extraneous and ulterior motives must be discouraged by imposing exemplary costs or by adopting similar novel methods to curb frivolous petitions and the petitions filed for extraneous considerations. Since Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Supreme Court has been issuing guidelines from time to time to put a check on these meaningless litigation, Government has no proposal to further interfere in such matter.",

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO THE PARTS (a) to (c) OF RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. *5 ASKED BY SARDAR SUKHDEV SINGH DHINDSA REGARDING AMENDMENTS IN THE WAKF ACT(a) The Punjab Wakf Board has submitted a memorandum regarding â<U+0080><U+009C>Amendment in the Wakf Act, 1995â<U+0080> to the Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Prime Minister of India vide their letter dated 19.3.2013 which was received in the Ministry of Minority Affairs vide PMO ID No. 3724319/PMO/2013-Pol dated 26.3.2013. The Punjab Wakf Board has also submitted another memorandum on this issue to Shri Sukhdev Singh Libra, Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha vide their letter dated 12.4.2013 which was received in this Ministry from the Office of the Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble Finance Ministerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s office vide letter dated 01.05.2013.(b) The details of the amendments proposed by the Punjab Wakf Board, in brief, are as under :- i) In the Wakf Act, 1995 there is no restriction on leasing and exchange of the land of wakf, graveyards. The State Wakf Boards, especially, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi have leased out thousands of acres of land of unused and abandoned wakf graveyards for cultivation since last many years, to save such waqf lands from encroachments and to increase income of Wakf Boards.ii) The State Wakf Boards of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan never lease out running graveyards. Only abandoned and unused lands of wakf graveyards, with no trace of graves, already under occupation, or threat, thereof, are leased out to save such wakf lands from encroachments and to generate revenue, with the conditions that whenever graveyards land is required for burial, it would be retrieved back by the Board. A part of even such unused graveyards land is reserved for burial purposes with boundary walls, if required. The leasing of Wakf graveyard or development of abandoned wakf graveyard (especially in urban areas) is not un-Islamic. iii) Amendment in Section 51 of the Wakf Act, 1995, has been proposed in the Wakf (Amendment) Bill, 2010, that no graveyard wakf land can be leased out or exchanged by the Wakf Boards. The present Wakf Act, 1995, does not bar leasing or exchange of the Wakf graveyards. Section 51 of the Wakf Act, 1995, clearly provides that Wakf graveyards can also be sold with prior sanction of the Board. In the proposed Wakf (Amendment) Bill, 2010, sale of graveyard lands is permissible but leasing or exchange of the same is prohibited. These two provisions in the amendment are contradictory and-2-against the interest of Muslim Community in many ways. Rather, it should have been otherwise in the amendment that the sale of wakf graveyards should have been prohibited and leasing or exchange should have been allowed. No safeguards has been proposed for graveyards already leased. Section 51 of Wakf Act, 1995 deals with alienation and not leasing. Leasing is not alienation.iv) The Representatives from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh have pleaded that there should not be any bar in leasing or exchange of wakf graveyard lands. Non-acceptance of the this suggestion of Punjab Wakf Board will have serious implications in the States like Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. (c) The (Amendment) Bill, 2010 with proposed amendments in the Wakf Act, 1995, was passed by the Lok Sabha on 7th May, 2010. The Bill was then referred to a Select Committee of Rajya Sabha. The Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha submitted its report on 16th December 2011 to the Rajya Sabha. The recommendations of the Select Committee were examined in the Ministry in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice and based on this, draft official amendments have been prepared by the Ministry of Law & Justice. The Bill is in the Rajya Sabha for consideration and passing. The amendments proposed by the Punjab Wakf Board are being examined. *******",

JAIPAL REDDY)(a)Yes Sir. (b)Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) has been providing the knowledgebase needed for the socio-economic development. During XI plan, CSIR operationalized a programme named â<U+0080><U+0098>CSIR-800â<U+0080><U+0099>, focused at bringing in desired S&T interventions for improving the quality of life of people at the base of the economic pyramid and removing drudgery.CSIR has adopted villages to promote employment generation. It has thus catalyzed commercial cultivation of Geranium in Uttaranchal and Lavender in Jammu & Kashmir through community participation. In this end to end mission farmers have been trained not only for cultivation of Geranium and Lavender but also for extraction of oil. Likewise CSIR efforts through development of niche Mentha varieties and their propagation for mass cultivation are noteworthy. The efforts have led India acquire a world leadership position in Menthol mint oil production and export.CSIR has set up post-harvest centres in Mizoram (Aizawl) and Arunachal Pradesh (Pashighat). These centres are focused at helping the local farmers in the region for value addition to their agricultural produce. The centres house technology for high efficiency drying and processing of ginger, cardamom, turmeric, chillies etc. the farmers are able to sell their produce at 20-25% higher price to these processing centres. The CSIR Post Harvest Technology Centres are thus generating direct employment. CSIR efforts have led to: empowering people at Kashmir Valley through creation of aromatic industry; development of bioinoculants for enhancing plant productivity, disseminated in UP to the farmers in partnership with the State Government on a very large scale and has enhanced agriculture productivity; mushroom technology transfer and training which has benefitted rural women in North East Sates; the ethnic products promotion for economic development which has benefitted the women entrepreneurs of Manipur.CSIR has developed indigenous substitute of Ukraine clay in granite ceramic tiles which has reduced the Ukraine clay requirement from 20% to about 1%. This has made major economic difference and benefitted small and medium scale enterprises in Gujarat.Over the years CSIR has developed technologies for: food and food processing; building and construction; enhancing potability of water; environment and sanitation; cultivation and processing of economic plants; rural roads; farm machinery; solar rickshaw (soleckshaw), leather; pottery etc. The technologies developed have been gainfully utilized in several states benefiting villages and small towns.CSIR is partnering with the National Innovation Council (NInC) to provide S&T interventions needed for enhancing the technological base of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). CSIR has adopted six clusters for the purpose. They are (i) Mango Cluster, Krishnagiri (ii) Brass Cluster, Moradabad (iii) Bamboo Cluster, Agartala (iv) Auto Cluster, Faridabad (v) Ayurveda Cluster, Thrissur and (vi) Life Sciences Cluster, Ahmedabad. As a part of this focused effort, CSIR has developed: protocol for enhancing the storage life of Krishnagiri mangoes from 7 days to 35 days; for Brass Cluster, Moradabad, a lacquer has been developed to give more shine to Moradabad Brass artifacts vis-Ã -vis Chinese Products; and for Agartala Bamboo Cluster, cheaper alternative to Jiget binding material for making Agarbatties has been developed.CSIR has been disseminating its knowledgebase in various states of country including Andhra Pradesh during XI plan. As a result several technologies are in use in many rural areas and small towns of Andhra Pradesh. Names of few such rural areas/ small towns in Andhra Pradesh include: (i) Samadhan Kendra â<U+0080><U+0093> A rural information technology center for farmers (Integral part of the India Development Gateway (InDG) Portal) in Nallajerla (covering 20 villages), Prattipadu (covering 20 villages), Pydiparru (covering 20 villages), and Balusumudi (covering 20 villages) of West Goavari District of Andhra Pradesh.

About 1 lakh population benefitted from each centre. (ii) Strategic Medicinal and Industrial Plants based technologies: Biovillages were set up on Citronella and Ashwagandha in dry belts of AP. As a result cultivation of Aswagandha increased to 505 ha area involving 200 farmers cultivating the crop in different drought prone areas of Andhra Pradesh and cultivation of Citronella spread over 1450 ha area involving 786 farmers in Vishakhapatnam district. CSIR initiatives carried out for several other states during XI plan are available at Annexure.During XII plan, CSIR has converted CSIR-800 programme into a full-fledged scheme. For XII plan, the technology focus areas under the CSIR-800 scheme are: (i) Affordable health and Nutrition; (ii) Potable Water and Sanitation;(iii)Affordable Housing; (iv) Sustainable Energy, (v) Value-added agriculture; (vi) Energy Efficiency; and (vii) Waste to Wealth. Technologies at different level of development would be implemented. Strategic implementation of the CSIR-800 scheme is focused on CSIR''s new initiative of several geographically distributed CSIR Technology-enabled Villages'' (TECHVIL) to take fruits of S&T to footsteps of the rural people by integrating S&T solutions with peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s needs.TECHVILs form the platforms where CSIR technologies, as needed by the village communities, are focused for economic growth and improvement in quality of life. CSIR has identified the districts that were declared backward by the Planning Commission for TECHVIL initiatives. CSIR scholars pursuing their PhD research in recently established AcSIR, have a mandatory requirement to undertake 4 Credit practical course of 8 weeks duration for addressing and solving a rural problem. Several hundreds of such scholars will act as a work force in implementation of S&T interventions on the ground for economic value addition and improvement in quality of life. Thus CSIR scientists have been concentrating in the rural areas and small towns. These efforts will be further scaled up through TECHVILs to fulfill the desirable objectives of the CSIR-800 scheme during XII plan.*******",

Out of 1217 teaching posts, 97 are SCs, 26 are STs and 17 are OBCs. (b): As per the information furnished by the IIT Kanpur, the sanctioned strength of teachers in IIT Kanpur is 566. Against the sanctioned strength, 336 teachers from General category and 2 teachers from SC category are in position as on 30.4.2013. No teacher from ST and OBC categories are in position presently. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) follow the Government of India policy of 15%, 7.5% and 27% reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs, respectively for recruitment to the posts of Assistant Professors in Science and Technology subjects and to all faculty posts in subjects other than Science and Technology. The reasons of faculty shortage in IITs, including IIT Kanpur are sharp increase in studentsâ<U+0080><U+0099> intake on account of OBC reservation policy from the year 2008-09 and non-availability of qualified candidates for taking up teaching assignments. (c) & (d): The Ministry, vide its letter dated 20.12.2011, requested the UGC and in turn the UGC wrote to all Central Universities (CUs) to launch a Special Recruitment Drive to fill up the backlog reserved vacancies for SCs, STs and OBCs identified as on 1.11.2008 and Persons with Disabilities as on 15.11.2009. The Ministry and the UGC through review meetings and reminders direct the CUs to fill the vacancies on priority. The vacancy of teachers was also discussed prominently in the Conference of the Vice-Chancellors (VCs) of the CUs on 5.2.2013 under the chairmanship of the Honâ<U+0080><U+0099>ble President of India, in which the VCs were exhorted to fill up the vacancies in a time bound manner. As a follow-up the Ministry, on 6.3.2013, has written to all the VCs to implement the decisions on priority and to furnish progress report on quarterly basis. In the recently held Conference of VCs on 19.7.2013 under the chairmanship of the Minister of Human Resource Development, the vacancy position of faculties including the reserved vacancies was reviewed in detail. While approving the budget estimates for the year 2012-13, the UGC has also directed the CUs to fill up the backlog reserved vacancies. The IITs, including IIT Kanpur have taken various initiatives to attract outstanding candidates for faculty positions. Some of these initiatives include year-round open advertisements, holding of selection committee meetings through video conferencing, invitation to alumni, scientists and faculty to reach out to potential candidates, advertisements in international journals, and outstanding young faculty awards. The teachers in IITs are encouraged to undertake consultancy and are given start-up financial support upto Rs. 5.00 lakh to take up research, besides professional development allowance. Recently, the Government has allowed the faculty working under the Central Government or Central Autonomous Bodies to join the newly set up central educational institutions on long-term deputation basis for a period of ten years. To tide over the shortage of teachers, the IITs also appoint NRIs and PIOs to the permanent faculty positions on same terms and conditions as those of the regular faculty. The filling up of all posts, including backlog vacancies depends on availability of suitable candidates. Therefore, it is not possible to indicate a definite time frame for the same. ******",

SHASHI THAROOR)(a) to (d) : There are sporadic reports in the media of suicides committed by the students of various categories. The Government takes each incident of suicide in Government run institutions extremely seriously, irrespective of the caste category of the victim. However, education being in the Concurrent List, the Central Government and State Governments are, therefore, equally responsible for eliminating such unfortunate incidents. Moreover, in some cases fact finding committees / inquiry committees were constituted by some of the premier educational institutes like the IITs and the NITs, which are autonomous bodies, governed by their respective Acts and Statutes. As per the findings of the committees, the reasons for suicides mainly include depression, academic load, peer pressure and also emotional / inter-personal issues. In addition, increased pressure on the wards by the parents to achieve high academic and professional targets unmindful of the ground realities has also contributed to increase stress and depression leading occasionally to suicides. While the Government is sensitive to the incidence of suicides in institutions of higher learning and makes all possible efforts to understand the causes of suicide and take concrete steps to remove them, each suicide however unfortunate is also the outcome of individual temperament and circumstance and no Government policy can eliminate entirely all resort to suicide. -2-Based on the reasons identified, the Institutes have put in place various mechanism to ensure that the interests of the students belonging to weaker sections not suffer. These include, provisions of faculty advisors for SC/ST students who look into their problems and advise accordingly, appointment of Student Counsellors to address personal, academic, psychological and family related problems, providing sports and extra curriculum activities, setting up yoga centers/counseling centers, provision of anxiety helpline, appointment of studentsâ<U+0080><U+0099> ombudsman, introduction of slow pace programme for academically weaker students and setting up disciplinary action committee to take urgent action in case of any complaint of reported ragging, discrimination based on caste, creed, religion and gender etc. Further, the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have notified regulations for prevention and prohibition of ragging in higher education institutions. The UGC also provides financial assistance to the universities to establish Equal Opportunity Cells to oversee the effective implementation of policies and programmes implemented for the welfare of the disadvantaged groups, to provide guidance and counselling with respect to academic, financial, social and other matters and to enhance diversity within the campus. The UGC also provides financial assistance to establish Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy to support focused research on the issue of social exclusion related to dalits, tribals and religious minorities. The UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2012 notified on 19.1.2013, provides for the establishment of Equal Opportunity Cells and the appointment of an Anti-Discrimination Officer in each higher educational institution to give effect to the Regulations.The Ministry of Human Resource Development have taken several specific anti-ragging measures such as advertisement campaigns in the print, audio and audio- visual media in order to sensitize various stakeholders towards the menace of ragging. An anti-ragging â<U+0080><U+0098>Helplineâ<U+0080><U+0099> is also functional with call centre facilities in English, Hindi and other Regional Languages for facilitating communication pertaining to incidents of ragging as well as to provide information on ragging and related issues.

However, this is not a factually correct assessment of the schemes of the Ministry of Minority Affairs. Under Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), in 90 Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) identified for the implementation of the scheme during 11th Plan, 90% of the target minorities belong to Muslim community as per the data of Census 2001. Similarly, under scholarship schemes of this Ministry, namely Pre-matric Scholarship, Post-matric Scholarship and Merit-cum-means Based Scholarship Schemes, about 78% scholarships have been awarded to the students belonging to Muslim community during 11th Five Year Plan. Remaining scholarships have been awarded to the students of other notified minority communities. In other individual beneficiary oriented schemes of this Ministry also, target is the people belonging to minority communities.(c) & (d): MsDP was launched in 2008 to address the development deficits of backward minority concentration areas as a follow up to Sachar Committee recommendations. So far, projects with central share of Rs. 6020.14 crore have been approved under MsDP to create socio-economic infrastructure and provide basic amenities in the identified MCDs.The Guidelines for MsDP provide that priority should be given to projects that focus on villages/blocks/localities, having substantial minority population. Most of the projects taken under MsDP are for creation of community assets and as stated above 90% of the target minorities in the identified MCDs belong to Muslim community as per the data of Census 2001.Further, to ensure the intended benefits are passed on to the targeted minority population including Muslims, the Ministry has restructured MsDP for sharper focus on minority concentration areas by making blocks/towns as unit of planning and implementation. 710 blocks and 66 towns have been identified for implementation of MsDP during 12th Five Year Plan.****",

The RTE (Amendment) Act, 2012 made a provision for home based education for children with multiple disabilities and severe disability and also included the children with disability in the definition of â<U+0080><U+009C>child belonging to disadvantaged groupâ<U+0080>. The RTE (Amendment) Act, 2009 also clarifies that this Act shall not apply to Madrasas, Vedic Pathshalas and educational institutions that are primarily imparting religious instruction. Concerns have also been raised in various fora on the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) and â<U+0080><U+0098>no detentionâ<U+0080><U+0099> policy in the context of â<U+0080><U+0098>no detentionâ<U+0080><U+0099> provision in the RTE Act.

A sub-committee of the CABE has also been set up to examine the feasibility of extending the RTE Act to secondary schools.The RTE Act, 2009 lays down norms and standards which must be adhered to by every school. Private unaided schools are also expected to provide 25% admissions to children from disadvantaged groups/ weaker sections under Section 12(1) (c) and the cost of education of these children will be reimbursed by the government. The RTE Act is intended to provide the right of education to children and is not targeted at addressing the financial viability of private schools.Improvement in quality of elementary education is a major objective of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)/RTE. To this end, States/UTs have been supported to appoint additional teachers to achieve Pupil-Teacher Ratio norms specified in Schedule to the RTE Act. As on date 19.85 lakh teachers posts have been sanctioned out of which14.15 lakh teachers have been appointed by the States/UTs. Since August, 2010 Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) has been made compulsory for appointment as teacher. The State Govts have been assisted to provide training to cover 6.6 lakh untrained teachers through open distance learning mode. The Govt is also focussing on early reading, writing and mathematics in class I and II, student learning standards, teacher performance and school performance standards to improve learning outcomes. There has been a conscious effort to involve the community in these endeavours through school Management Committees (SMC) in which parents whose children study in the school account for 75% of the SMC membership.Other concerns of the stakeholders are also addressed by clarifications issued as Advisories/ Guidelines under Section 35(1) of the RTE Act, 2009 from time to time.

However, this is not a factually correct assessment of MsDP. Under Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), in 90 Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) identified for the implementation of the scheme during 11th Plan, 90% of the target minorities belong to Muslim community as per the data of Census 2001. Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) has been effectively implemented since 2008-09.

The progress in implementation is slow in some of the States due to delay in receipt of the plan proposals from States/UTs, delay in release of funds by the State to the implementing agencies, non-availability of land for construction projects and delay in fixation of executing agencies by the State Government.(b) In chapter titled â<U+0080><U+0098>Assessing UPA Governmentâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Response to Muslim Deprivationâ<U+0080><U+0099> of Social Development Report 2012 of Council for Social Development, it has been mentioned that there is lack of focus only on the minority population, lack of fund and cautious response due to politics of polarization. However, this is not a factually correct assessment of the programmes of the Government for the minority welfare. On the basis of Sachar Committee Report, a total of 76 recommendations were listed and out of them 72 recommendations were approved by the Government. Broadly Government took 43 decisions in respect to the 72 recommendations. Some of the recommendations were clubbed together. The responsibility for implementation of these decisions has been given to the concerned Ministries/Department. These recommendations mainly relate to the following sectors: (i) Educational empowerment - Providing free and high quality education to children up to the age of 14, opening government schools in minority concentration areas, awarding scholarships, modernizing Madrasas etc.(ii) Access to credit â<U+0080><U+0093> Promoting and enhancing access to minorities in Priority Sector Lending, open more branches in minority concentration areas, promote micro -finance among women etc. (iii) Skill development â<U+0080><U+0093> Opening ITIs and polytechnics to focus on high growth potential in the minority concentration areas.

The opinion(s), view(s) and conclusion(s) expressed in the working paper series are those of the authors and not that of IIM-Ahmedabad. The author in his working paper has, inter alia, observed the following:(i) Participation of Muslims is relatively low in the education space but has improved in recent years. The situation in the urban areas is, however, poor especially for Muslim males;(ii) The participation of Muslims in higher education is particularly poor but once they cross the threshold of school education and other factors that affect participation in higher education, the deficits for Muslims decline significantly;(iii) Household endowments alongwith location play a critical role in determining participation of Muslims in education. There is some evidence to suggest that the community does not fully appreciate the rewards of education even as returns to education are high.(iv) Muslims are predominantly engaged in self-employment and their participation as regular worker especially in the tertiary sector (that has grown in recent years) in urban areas is low as compared to other socio religious communities (SRCs).As per the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) Report on employment and unemployment situation among major religious groups in India (2009-10), inter alia, the following has been observed:(i) In 2009-10, the average monthly per capita consumer expenditure (MPCE) for Muslims was Rs.980/- as compared to all India average MPCE of Rs.1128/-.(ii) Among Muslims of age 15 years and above, the literacy rates for rural males, rural females, urban males and urban females were 69%, 47%, 81% and 65% respectively.(iii) In urban areas, proportion of workers engaged in self employment was the highest for Muslims. Regular employment among Muslims were lowest both in urban areas and rural areas amongst major religious groups. (iv) Unemployment rate for Muslims have declined in 2009-10 as compared to 2004-05 in both rural and urban areas. Among minorities, the unemployment rate in rural areas was lowest for Muslims. In urban areas unemployment rate was lowest for Christians followed by Muslims.

Since Government also took the decision to transfer Dr. Khobragade to the Indian Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York, to safeguard her from further legal issues in the U.S., the U.S. side eventually provided her full diplomatic immunity, enabling her to leave the country, although the case remained in court.The two countries have since agreed to initiate an official dialogue to comprehensively address all aspects related to the case against Dr. Khobragade, including IndiaÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s demand for dropping of all charges, and all issues arising from differing perspectives on diplomatic privileges and immunities. (c) There have been previous instances of Indian diplomats, political leaders, and other eminent people being subjected to enhanced security screening at airports in the US. These include Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, former President [John F. Kennedy International airport, New York; September 2011]; Shri Praful Patel, Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises [Chiago OÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>Hare airport; September 2010 and June 2013]; Shri Mohammed Azam Khan, Minister of Urban Development and Parliament Affairs, Government of UP [Logan International Airport, Boston; April 2013]; Smt.

[Austin airport, Texas; November 2010]; and Shri Shah Rukh Khan, Actor [White Plains airport, New York; April 2012].(d) The Government has consistently expressed its displeasure to the United States Government over such incidents. It has urged the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure prevention of such occurrences in future. The Government has also conveyed that while it respects the rights of each country to institute necessary security procedures at their airports, internationally recognized diplomatic courtesies and privileges, as also religious and cultural sensitivities, must be respected. The U.S. Government has expressed regret for several of these incidents and conveyed that it would look at ways to prevent such incidents. *****",198129.0

M. VEERAPPA MOILY)(a) The main source of pollution of river Yamuna is the untreated/ partially treated domestic sewage discharged into the river through the drains which join the river from the towns located on the banks of the river. As per the information provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), sewage pollution is mainly contributed by the towns of Yamunanagar, Jagadhri, Karnal, Panipat, Sonepat, Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad, Palwal, Vrindavan, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad and Etawah. Delhi is the largest contributor of sewage pollution load to river Yamuna. As per the water quality monitoring of Yamuna by CPCB, the stretch of river Yamuna from origin to Wazirabad in Delhi is found to be largely within the prescribed limits with respect to dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). However, Wazirabad to Okhla in Delhi and Kosi Kalan to Juhika in Uttar Pradesh have been identified as polluted stretches. (b) & (c) Conservation of rivers is an ongoing and collective effort of the Central and State Governments. The Ministry is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the problem of pollution of river Yamuna by providing financial assistance to Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana under Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) since 1993 in a phased manner. A total expenditure of Rs. 1453.17 crore (including State share) has been incurred on schemes pertaining to sewerage/interception and diversion of drains, rehabilitation/upgradation of existing sewage treatment plants (STPs) and construction of new STPs, low cost sanitation/community toilet complexes, electric/improved wood crematoria, etc under YAP Phase-I & II in the three States. Sewage treatment capacity of 942.25 million litres per day (mld) has been created under YAP so far. Further, YAP Phase-III project for Delhi has been approved with an estimated cost of Rs 1656 crore. Under YAP-III, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) is implementing rehabilitation of existing trunk sewers and rising mains, upgradation of existing STPs of 814 mld and construction of a new 136 mld STP (in place of the old STP).

These guidelines prescribe that the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) conduct water quality assessment of the water body before and after immersions, post the data on internet and help local administration in preparing material for mass awareness for the purpose. Further, the guidelines prescribe that idols be made from natural materials like traditional clay, water soluble and nontoxic natural dyes be used for painting of idols, worship material like flowers, clothes, decorating material (made of paper and plastic) be removed before immersion of idols, biodegradable materials collected separately for recycling or composting, non-biodegradable materials disposed off in sanitary landfills, immersion of idols in river be done at identified idol immersion spots along the river bank in temporary ponds having earthen bunds with removable synthetic liners at bottom, etc. The guidelines have been circulated to all States and Union Territories for implementation.*****",198692.0

The location-wise details of forty centrally protected monuments/site declared as of national importance under the jurisdiction of Archaeological Survey of India in Himachal Pradesh are at Annexure-I. There are 327 heritage buildings notified in the year 2003 and further 88 heritage buildings in the year 2011 were notified by the Government of Himachal Pradesh as per details at Annexure-II and IIa respectively. (b)&(c) There is no apparent threat to these centrally protected monuments/site to catch fire. However, as some of these monuments are largely made of wood, and some others have wooden components in their architectural schemes, the Archaeological Survey of India has procured (a) Water (stored pressure) type fire extinguishers, and (b) Carbon dioxide type fire extinguishers. While the former types are useful to extinguish or control general fires resulting from wood, paper, cloth, etc., in emergency situations, the latter are used to fight the electric and delicate machinery (such as computer, etc.) fires. The Viceregal Lodge, Shimla which has its interior largely made of wood, has an effective fire-fighting system in place since colonial times and is still satisfactory working.ANNEXURE Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093>IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 159 FOR 3.12.2014LIST OF CENTRALLY PROTECTED MONUMENTS IN HIMACHAL PRADESHSl.No. Name of the Monument / Site Location District1 Ganesh temple Bharmaur Chamba2 Laxmi (Lakhana) Devi temple Bharmaur Chamba3 Mani Mahesh temple Bharmaur Chamba4 Nar Singh temple Bharmaur Chamba5 Shri Bajreshwari temple, Badrinath Chamba Chamba6 Shri Bansi Gopal temple Chamba Chamba7 Shri Chamunda temple Chamba Chamba8 Shri Hari Ram temple Chamba Chamba9 Shri Laxmi Narian group of temple in Mohalla Hathnala Chamba Chamba10 Rock sculptures depicting Sita Ram, Hanuman etc. Chamba Chamba11 Shri Sita Ram temple in Mohalla Bangota Chamba Chamba12 Shri Shakti Devi temple Chhatrari Chamba13 Champavati Temple, Himachal Pradesh Chamba Chamba14 Katoch Palace Tira Sujanpur Hamirpur 15 Narbadeshwar temple including the paintings therein as well as subsidiary shrines within the compound wall Sujanpur Hamirpur16 Temple Ashapur Kangra17 Temple of Baijnath Baijnath Kangra18 Temple of Sidhnath Baijnath Kangra19 Buddhist stupa known as Bhim-ka-Tila Chaitru Kangra20 Ruined fort Kangra Kangra21 Rock inscription Khanyara Kangra22 Fort Kotla Kangra23 Rock cut temple with sculptures Masrur Kangra24 Ruined fort Nurpur Kangra25 Rock inscription Pathiar Kangra26 Lord Eligin''s tomb Dharamshala Kangra27 Temple of Basheshar Mahadev at Hat Bajaura Kullu28 Temple of Gauri Shankar with sculptures Dasa Kullu29 A Miniature stone shiva temple Jagatsukh Kullu30 Temple of Gauri Shankar with sculptures Naggar Kullu31 Hidamba Devi temple Manali Kullu32 Buddhist Monastery Tabo Lahaul & Spiti33 Phoo Gumpha Tabo Lahaul & Spiti34 Mirkula Devi temple Udaipur (Lahaul) Lahaul & Spiti35 Barsela Monuments Mandi Mandi36 Panchvaktra Temple Mandi Mandi37 Trilokinath Temple Mandi Mandi38 Ardhnareshwar Templef Mandi Mandi39 Shiva temple Mangarh Sirmaur40 Vice Regal Lodge (Rashtrapati Niwas) Shimla ShimlaANNEXURE Ã¢<U+0080><U+0093>IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 159 FOR 3.12.2014LIST OF HERITAGE BUILDINGS IN SHIMLA NOTIFIFED BY TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH S.

(d): Import duty of dry forms of NR was raised from Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>20% or Rs 20 per kg whichever is lowerÃ¢<U+0080>Â to Ã¢<U+0080><U+009C>20% or Rs 30 per kg whichever is lowerÃ¢<U+0080>Â in December 2013.

The contents of this news clip were centered on begging & rag picking, drugging etc. by street children in and around the North District of Delhi Police. In view of the news report, joint raids along with the staff of concerned Channel and also separate raids under the supervision of ACP/Kotwali were conducted to identify and nab the criminals involved in alleged crimes against children but no such organized criminal activity could be noticed. However, continuous efforts are made by Delhi Police in this regard to identify and nab the criminals, if any, involved in such crimes. During the year 2014, raids were conducted on 6/2/14, 7/2/14, 12/3/14, 22/8/14, 26/9/14 under Child Labour Act, Bonded Labour Act and Juvenile Justice Act and 64 children have been rescued in the North District and legal action taken against 14 accused persons. All beat and division staff officers have been sensitized to keep watch over such activities and to nab such criminals committing crime against children. ContÃ¢<U+0080>Â¦2/--2-R.S.US.Q.No. 1167 for 3.12.2014So far as the issue of drugging is concerned, it is to mention that in the area shown in the clipping, the drugs mostly consumed are not the Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>narcotic drugsÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> or Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>psychotropic substancesÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> as defined under Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act, 1985Ã¢<U+0080><U+0099> like Opium, Cannabis, Cocaine etc. Most commonly consumed substances include Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>AvilÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099> in injection form, ink remover/correction fluid (which is inhaled) and other such fluids, which are not covered under NDPS Act. However, strict watch is kept by Delhi Police over sale and consumption of contraband drugs. During the year 2014, 06 FIRs were registered regarding sale of contraband drugs in North District, in which 09 persons were arrested. The area of North District shown in the news clip is in close vicinity of several night shelters for homeless people raised by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) of the GNCT of Delhi. Thousands of homeless people stay in the night shelters, many of whom sustain on begging. Begging is prevalent in the area also due to proximity to the famous Hanuman Temple which is thronged by devotees who distribute Ã¢<U+0080><U+0098>prasadÃ¢<U+0080><U+0099>/ offerings which become an easy source of food and reason for begging for the poor, but no organized and forced begging has come to light so far. Local police staff has been directed to keep close watch on any organized criminal activity against children. However, in the instant matter an enquiry has been ordered to look into the aspect of organized criminal activity and involvement of staff of local police, if any, and further pursuant action will be taken accordingly. *****",204819.0
